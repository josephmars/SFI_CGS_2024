When I got the job I was up front and direct about my disability (known disability, I receive ridiculous amount of meds and I see psychology every month. Note. Psychology not counseling)

Work tried to say ""it was just counseling"" when it isn't. I gave them a letter from my psychologist. 

So background. 

Got the job in 2023. 
It's an agency I would have expected better from (read: government). 

I was put through literally traumatic levels of ""fill this form out so we can help you"". 

The form required obscene amounts of details into my depression, my PTSD, as well as my cancer (which is under investigation). 

So we did the whole traumatic history, then we had *agreed* reasonable adjustments. 

The company have directly not adhered to those reasonable adjustments and instead has penalized me for using them. 


I.e. main one, is directly due to my disability I may not be Able to work in the office on my given office days. 
This was agreed with my self, management, higher management as a reasonable adjustment. 

Now, among other shit my neddy manager is bringing forth, they're saying ""there is a pattern of me asking to work from home on office days""


....which..... obviously.....I'm not going to request to wfh on the days ...that I already....work from fucking home.  "

Luckily I’m an intern so I don’t have any serious obligations or ties to said company. 

The last straw for me was this past week, when we started working on something for me to sort of present and then (i’ll just call him John) tells me to type up a SCRIPT for the presentation that sounds like I’m saying it. I mean it’s kinda pointless but o still wouldn’t have been bothered doing it IF he didn’t sound so condescending or authoritative. He was legit like “I WANT xyz”. 

And then John tries to backtrack by saying stuff like “not tryna nitpick at you or anything” or “not tryna micromanage” or “I know this sucks but”. Which are all just red flags to me. I was considering coming back but even if I get a return offer I won’t accept because I know I’ll end up full time on that same spot.

The micromanagement goes back to a couple of weeks ago where he’d schedule multiple meetings with me per day, or bug me about timesheets every single day, telling me not to go over 40h etc. 
I read the company reviews and saw a lot of people talk about the high turnover.

There’s more but I’ll stop here because I don’t want this to get too long. 

 If I get a FT job it’s gotta be remote or nothing, can’t constantly deal with BS like this in person.

 I honestly don’t even see myself in corporate long term because I have alternative sources of passive income that’s making me enough per month to survive on alone."

I don’t give a shit about this last job bc I’m only there for another month or two (I could get fired tomorrow and just get another bogstandard job), they don’t know I’m leaving soon.

Here’s how a conversation went a few weeks ago.

Coworker: you need to be in 5 minutes before the shift starts for the handover

Me: I definitely don’t, I start at 10

Coworker: if the handover isn’t done you won’t know  the information necessary for the night’s work

Me: They can write it in the book or relay it to the manager (who gets in earlier than me).

*coworker snitches to manager bc they’re a dick and a kissass who loves being shat on and making little money*

Manager: coworker said you refuse to come in for the handover

Me: I’m happy to come in if I’m paid for it, but I’m not coming in 5 minutes a day early without pay - doing that everyday works out to be an extra 2 hours a month I’m working unpaid

Manager: we can’t pay you an extra 5 minutes a day, all of the other coworkers come in happily for the handover

Me: If you’re asking employees to come in unpaid because there isn’t a handover system in place aside from ‘work for free’ then there’s something seriously wrong with this place

Manager: I’ll highlight this to upper management but I’d reconsider coming in for handover

Me: pay me an extra 2 hours a month then I’ll be happy to - until then I’m paid 10-6 so I’ll work 10-6.

*end of conversation*

I haven’t come in early. Nobody has said anything about it since. It feels so fucking good to tell them where to stick it. I’m sorry to so many of you that don’t have the freedom to say this like I do."

However. I have been sick since Saturday afternoon. It started with a migraine which developed into gastrointestinal issues and it’s now Monday…I am still in pain and feel gross. I decided that even though we are short staffed,my supervisor does have people she could use just for today. It’ll be an extremely slow day,so a newer hire could handle it. But I still feel so bad. I know that part of the reason I feel so sick is because I haven’t rested but I feel so selfish for deciding that it’s important today. Even though I know my work will decline if I’m not feeling well.

My supervisor can be really mean about these things. She complains about how rude it is when she has to cover other people,and that it’s not fair. I know she’ll be talking poorly of me even though just last week she was bragging on how great my coworker and I are doing over on our branch. I’m just stressed.

I previously worked for a company where my colleague, a 60-year-old man earning slightly more than me (minimum wage of 7.90 plus an extra 3), exhibited a superiority complex. Admittedly, I wasn't the most exemplary person, but when I inquired about my employment contract, his response was dismissive, asking, ""Why do you care so much about that? Are you a lawyer or something?"" I don't want to be working here at 60 years old, earning 10.90, and being treated like a number. I'm only here for the money and the benefits.

We were decent coworkers and got along fine. I told him I had lost my pen and safety knife, and he said, ""Okay, just use mine for now,"" which I did. Later that week, he went on holiday, leaving me alone. I faced an unfair challenge to build and ship 40 units within a week to ""meet my standards."" I accomplished that and more, but on Friday, I was brought into the main office by the big boss. Right after generating about3 million for the company that week, he sat me down for a ""review"" and said, ""I'm sorry, but your employment with us has ended. Please hand over all our property and leave the premises."" When I inquired about the reason for my termination, all I received was, ""You did not meet expectations."" I requested all the data they had on me—emails, texts, etc. It took them four months to provide half of what I requested. Among the data was an email from my co-worker to the boss saying I ""lost my knife, messed up the workstation"" even though I cleaned it five times, and other remarks about my supposed dissatisfaction with my job. like damn at least, lube me up before you rawdog my ass.

I don't know how to explain it but out of the 11 years they accuse them a week after I reported and show no proof of my parents stealing? "

My boss is literally the devil reincarnate. He pays us late with blank checks just because he can (in his words). He keeps secrets from us which affects our ability to do our jobs correctly. He only speaks about us in a negative manner when we’re not present. He undertrained me and criticizes every mistake I make but does not speak to me directly so I can improve. He is known to be quite racist and uses the n-word in the presence of black employees and has been accused of SA by other former employee(s).  

The new manager was alright at first but she’s proving to be just like him. For 2 weeks in a row she has given me less days and hours. Last week she scheduled herself a 10 hour shift so I offered to open or close so she doesn’t have to work all day and she completely ignored me. Then on the same day I offered to come in, she asks me to close but I declined since that offered expired. Yesterday, she made our new schedule. I asked for Tuesday off but she asked me to come in to open so I agreed and confirmed the schedule for this week. Our other coworker offers to come in on Tuesday and Wednesday (the two days she’s off that I’m working) so the manager just gives away my Tuesday shift after I confirmed that I will be working and then ignored me when when I reiterated that I’m working Tuesday. 

This workspace has become so hostile and toxic but are these valid reasons to quit?

I have had great attendance, and my performance was up to standards. Well at least that’s what they told me during the meeting.

So I get to work and clock in. Everything goes smoothly I even decide to clock in 5 mins early and begin working. It’s a Monday and I know we all want to go home so I made sure I put a little extra kick in my step. This was 7am. I worked like normal and then around 8:45am I get called to the office and I was like hmm this is weird ( I haven’t ever been called to the office. )…. 

When I get into the office I ask “hey what’s going on?” They respond with “we are sorry to inform you but we have a high head count and you guys were the two lowest on the totem pole so they decided to let you guys go”. I give them a dirty look like I’m annoyed I’m sure they could tell I was annoyed and then proceeded to say “its nothing performance related or attendance wise it’s just that we have too high of a head count right now but we will let you know if anything changes”……

So when I clocked in this morning I quite literally witnessed three “new hires”. So I don’t understand the logic behind firing good workers for brand new ones. And then lie and say its because there are too many people. 

Why are jobs able to do this? What do I do untill I get another job? Can I get unemployment benefits?

I’m at a loss. I have a daughter this is so fucked up. There should be a law where they have to give a two weeks notice just like we do. "

You can read it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1deuh0c/would_i_be_wrong_to_quit/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


To sum it up though, I'm 20 years old and worked as a receptionist from 7 - 5. It drained me so much that I couldn't enjoy life anymore. The issue was that my dad also worked in a management position rhere.


Alot of the comments on my previous post said to talk to my dad and I took that advice. Unfortunately, he wasn't as supportive as most people assumed he would be. He's been wanting me to become an accountant for a while now, my parents even used my college money to enroll me in short accounting courses, even though I told them countless times that I don't want to become an accountant, much less work in an office.


When I told my parents that I'm going to quit, I was told that I would be making a great mistake and that the time isn't right. The week that followed was me being extremely depressed that I couldn't escape from a job that was eating me alive mentally. Something in me broke when a customer yelled at me for something that wasn't even my fault, and I decided I would quit that Friday afternoon. I was even more justified when my manager (not my dad) blamed me for not ensuring that there's stock in our storage, even though he's the one who orders stock, and I gave him the list of everything that should be ordered 3 WEEKS ago.


I gave in my notice and omg I feel so much lighter. My parents weren't very happy, especially my mother. My dad was disappointed, but he told me that even though he's unhappy, he'd still support me. I cannot fathom how free I feel, knowing that this is the first time I actually stood up for myself and took my life into my own hands. I can't believe that I'm 20 years old and I was still doing as I was told. I'm going to follow the career that I want to and I'm going to make it work, no matter what anyone says. 


I guess I want to close with this; if you feel stuck in a place you don't want to be in, take that leap. Do yourself a favour and don't suffer at the hands of people who don't care about you."

So say we're talking about the US, and we bumped up the federal minimum wage to, e.g. $25 USD. Or we started giving everyone a $2000/month UBI. In such a case, what's stopping companies from increasing prices by a proportional amount? E.g. if the average consumer's income is doubled, what's stopping all the suppliers like Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds, pharmaceuticals, housing developers, Netflix, etc. from simply charging double, or close to double?

If the theory is that companies will charge as much as people can pay, wouldn't they just jack up prices, and we go back to square 1, where people at the bottom struggle to meet basic needs?"

Every time I witness this it both fascinates and alarms me. That a person can be so utterly vile, then just switch it off and genuinely expect their victim to forget what they've just done really blows my mind. 

Is it a lack of self-awareness, the ability to compartmentalise, or, even worse, a sick thrill from making the person they've just brutalised pretend to laugh at their brainless jokes?

Collective flag destruction would have been perfect to organize for July 4th, but I didn't think of it until now.

#Why Flag Desecration for Protest?

🗽 It's cheap, safe and easy to organize. You don't have to call off work like in a labor strike. We can do it nationwide and upload it to social media. We don't have to group up in masse. You can rip it, burn it, soil it, bury it, draw on it. Creative forms go a long way to send a message. This movement will definitely catch media attention and will be reported on the news. 

🗽 You can protect your identity in this extreme but peaceful form of protest

🗽 We are not represented by our government and haven't been for a long time. From labor issues to housing and homeless, ongoing genocide and needless war, abuse of our tax dollars etc

🗽 They've attacked Women's and LGBTQ rights, abuse of Religion over State, Project 2025, Fossil Fuels industry destroying the environment globally 

🗽 Our presidential election is a JOKE. Neither presidents have our best interest. Biden and Trump are genocidal, authoritative, and untrustworthy to say the least

#Will Flag Desecration actually change anything?

🗽 No, I am not saying it'll solve all our problems but no single protest does. The important part is collective action and sending a message to those in power that cannot be misinterpreted. We as citizens will benefit by feeling united against our common enemy, and will help future movements.

🗽 This movement needs to go viral to be effective. We want the news to talk about it. We want it to spread to the working class who can't be bothered.

  🗽 Ultimately, I think Flag Desecration will benefit us as long as enough of us do it and keep up the momentum. We've unionized, boycotted, and filled the streets already in peaceful protest. We need to do more.

#I still think Flag Desecration is too much

🗽 If you're uncomfortable destroying a real flag, you can draw or paint or use merchandise with flag motifs. Remember you can be creative !

A lot of here wish we were more like the French. Well, here ya go!     Ideally we can create a subreddit to upload and track this protest. More ideally it'll spread to Tiktok and Twitter. 

Thoughts? How to make this better/more effective? Other creative methods?"

This leaves less time for actual work, which reduces productivity, which makes senior management more obsessed with tracking productivity to try and figure out what the problem is.

I left with no vehicle, no real backup, I just happen to be fortunate enough to not have to pay exorbitant rent. I do still make ""a living"" selling home grown herbs and fruit trees but it amounts to less than 200$ per month. I now have a truck that runs and drives, albeit not legally because I can't afford insurance and not safely because I can't afford tires.

I guess my question is, I can't just sit at home all day every day, I don't live in a walkable area (a mile into town on the side of an extremely dangerous highway),  with my minimal income I can't afford to actually do anything. 

How the hell am I supposed to keep my mental health in any sort of a steady state? I can't afford medication, therapy, any sort of medical help in any way, etc. 

Not to mention that I can't afford to grow the home business at all to make more money nor could I defect and get employment without a legal vehicle. 

This is just a rant, I'm lost. 

TLDR: Customer service broke me and now I don't know what to do with my life. "

I am supposed to keep on working until my last day at the company and I cannot find a way to do it. I just have an urge to sabotage my team that is pressuring me to finish the project before my last day at the  company, but there's no more gas left in the tank anymore.

I immediately had two companies try to pick me up.  One attempted to hire me twice last year (and would be exactly what I was previously doing); the other (we'll call them Key City) was a surprise.  I would be working in a very similar field, but a slightly different position and it had a location advantage.

I was really at odds internally and was honest and upfront with both places that I was very conflicted.

Key City sent an official job offer and gave me 5 days to sign it. I planned to wait it out until the last day so I could really think things through.  The day before, they emailed and said: ""Hey, don't sign that job offer, we are posting another position we think you'll be perfect for.  All the terms of the previous offer remain the same; we'll send you a new description.""

It took them another four days to send the description.  When I read it, I was excited, because it was a management position, but I also noticed it involved A LOT more responsibility.  And since the terms were the same as the previous job, the salary would be the same.

I very tactfully sent an email saying that I read the description, it sounded exciting but appeared to be a lot more responsibility.  I asked if they were still hiring for the other job, or if that was being absorbed by this new position.

Their response was that when they were drafting the job description, they thought of me and how well I'd fit the role.  I decided to wait for the posting and apply, but never saw it.  They were really, really busy over the last couple of weeks with a local crisis, so I held off on contacting them until late last week and again this morning.

They are now not responding to my emails.  I'm guessing my inquiry about the additional responsibilities and my lack of gushing about the new position turned them off.  

I'm not sure whether to be more annoyed with myself or them.  I dont' really like how they switched the job but not the pay just before hiring me, but I'm also a little incensed with myself for not jumping at a management position with more enthusiasm.

To give you some background, my previous career was incredibly flexible and I worked 4 a.m. to 1 p.m., came and went as I wanted, attended appts, etc without using PTO...just a lot of personal freedom that most people dream of having at work.

This place would likely be much more anal about tracking employees and was an 8 to 5 schedule, which would be a HUGE adjustment for me, one that I wasn't particularly thrilled about.

For a little backstory, my company is downsizing by the way of shortening hours, closing locations and eliminating services offered. So in an effort to avoid the total fallout, I saw an opportunity to apply for a promotion at another company. 

Despite having a successful initial screening and first round phone interview; today I went on the in-person interview… it was a traumatic experience. 

I felt instantly judged by the general manager. 

I was told there were several internal candidates and if I was hired that would be a contentious situation. 

I was told they opened up the position to external candidates to better compare us to their internal candidates. 

I was asked tricky questions about 
if I would be ok showing  preferential treatment.

The manager who interviewed me , insinuated I don’t have the right experience for their “affluent clientele”. 

When I sighted a specific stat based on my success, I was laughed at. 

At the end of the day corporate is going to corporate no matter the industry! "
6,2024-07-01,Burnt out and bitter (Just kinda venting),u/Guba_the_skunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dt2eee/burnt_out_and_bitter_just_kinda_venting/,antiwork,"I've already made several posts regarding past employment situations.  So instead I am going to post about three recent situations instead, all of them involve being passed over for a job, and people using the infamous ""Nobody wants to work anymore"" line.



So first up, several weeks ago a new store was opening in town.  Smoke shop, not really my first choice admittedly, but they were offering $15 an hour and fulltime benefits for 3-4 days a week.  Sure they were 10 hour days, but with paid lunches and their idea of full time was 36-40 hours.  So I reached out to them, got a same day interview, expressed interest in the shop and being full-time, and even offered my weekends up.  They agreed to hire me on the spot.  Hooray.  They got me the necessary paperwork, everything was going great.

A few days later they asked me to come attend a meeting to discuss the store, and meet other employees.  Again things went well I thought, I stayed quiet and just took in the information.  They talked a lot about vaping, the various vape types, filters, cartridge, etc.  I focused on absorbing as much information as possible, and even sent a text to my future potential boss afterwards with my email and asked them to send anything they wanted me to read up on.  You know, really showing an interest in the business and showing I wanted to be a good employee.

Then a week-ish after the interview they sent me a text asking if I could come help out just setting up shelves and displays.  I told them I had a dental appointment but could come in after, which they said was fine as they themselves wouldn't even be in town until later that day with the shelving units.  I did my appointment and ended up still being super out of it on anesthesia from it, but showed up half an hour early.  Again, wanting to show I was an eager, excited to work, hard working employee.  They set out a short task list involving cleaning the glass displays and emptying the trailer, which I did alone for 30 minutes until other staff arrived.  Then after finishing the unloading I started opening boxes and sorting everything to maximize efficiency while they went and got some tools.

The rest of the day I helped set up shelving units, which they did not secure properly and each shelf support had a total of three screws per support.  And organized the displays, which they ended up just haphazardly placing in the middle of the room.  Then they called it a day and we all left, with them giving me tax paperwork to drop off the next day...  A couple days after that I got a text... Saying this:

""(My name) I am sorry to inform you that I will not be hiring you.. we are looking for vibrant, talkative and most of all energetic people to work for us..  I don’t think this will be a good fit for you. I will be paying you 100$ cash for the 3 hours of help the other day when I come up there next.. Again my apologies for having to make this decision..""

So... Showing up early, reaching out to THEM, passing the interview, showing interest above and beyond what was required, making an effort to streamline the work, and even willing to show up after a dental procedure while still messed up on anesthesia... Not good enough, I didn't talk enough, and wasn't energenic enough for them.  I've been stewing over this for a couple weeks now, and am debating reporting them to OSHA for their insecure shelving, the labor department for literally offering to pay cash AFTER essentially hiring me, and the state/city for violating a law that prohibits the use of flashing neon signs (a thing they have).  Feels petty, but I am really burning up over the situation.  I did everything I was told would impress employers and... They didn't care.



The second thing is mostly my fault.  I was sending a package out and was stopped at the local post office by a lady asking everyone to consider applying for work.  So I did.  But was rejected because even though recreational use of THC products (not specifically cannabis, Minnesota laws are kind of a mess right now) is legal here, federally it's still a schedule 1 drug and illegal.  But I am still bitter about it because I partske at the recommendation of my therapist, and am currently in the middle of getting a medical cannabis card.  It's so legal here I can grow somewhere between 4 and 16 plants in my living room.  But I can't have a job at the post office because of it.  It almost feels discriminatory because I take THC for depression, it's a medical need.  The TL;DR on why cannabis and not any other drugs/meds... Well none of anyones business, but so far none of the meds I have taken have helped.  I've done dozens of antidepressants from paxil to Wellbutrin, and it wasn't until I casually tried a cannabis infused beverage out of curiosity did I feel better.  Like... Results within 6 months, years of antidepressants didn't help, getting high twice a week DID.  My therapist has said I have been ""brighter"" and ""happier"" over the last few months, vs the first year I was seeing her.

But cannabis is illegal federally and as such, can't work as a part time mail clerk.  Not even with a medical card.


Third and final story is just me being angry that a really good, really well paying job... Doesn't pay enough to live.  Basically there was a job in Seattle WA, I met all the requirements, but they only want to pay $25 an hour.  Which is a lot, more than I have ever been paid in my life, enough to live extremely comfortably just about anywhere... But not seattle.  According to a bit of googling you need to be making about $42 an hour to live in seattle, especially since median rent is around $2200.  Quick math on that, thats 88 hours at $25 an hour to make rent.  So 2 and 1/4 weeks of pay, before accounting for taxes.  Making it... Unaffordable.  Not that it would matter, I've barely got $1200 to my name, so relocating would have been an issue.  And so I continue my hunt for a better job while slowly wasting away at my current job.  While also listening to my parents bitch and moan about how ""no one wants to work anymore"" and how ""If minimum wage was $15 we would have to close our store, we can't afford that"" and also bitching about how much everything coats now, somehow completely oblivious to how that's ALSO how everyone feels, and increased minimum wage would also increase the amount of money we all have to spend on things.


Anyways.  Thanks for listening, or not.  I don't care.  I am just hoping that by putting this out into the world I can stop being angry about all of it.  It's been a hell of a month."

13,2024-07-01,No more remote work. Move back to office location or voluntarily quit (long),u/maggs813,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dt3mir/no_more_remote_work_move_back_to_office_location/,antiwork,"I have worked for a big company (MA) for a little less than 9 years. The last 6 of which I worked remotely under a policy that left work location up to direct supervisors. The company went fully remote for the pandemic and have been slowly trying to bring employees back into the office for the past year or so. 

Two years ago when everyone was still remote, I requested a remote exception allowing me to work remotely from another state where my family and I were relocating to help care for our elderly parents. The remote exception was approved with the caveat that It would need to be renewed every year. It was renewed again last year, but this year they changed the renewal date to the end of August this year. 

My managers submitted my exception in June and the process seemed a little more complicated this time and there were rumblings that it would be harder to get an exception this year. I wasn’t too worried about it because I was a top performer in my group and had never had any issues with my performance. 

About 3 weeks ago, I was pulled into a meeting with my a manager three levels above me and was told that my exception was not being renewed because the company wanted everyone back into the office permanently for the sake of the business. I was told I would be able to stay 6 months and then I would have to voluntarily leave the company. They said there would be no severance and that I would hear more details by the end of June.

I expected a package of information about the details of the next steps. Last week I received an email that again stated that my exception wasn’t being approved and that I would have to sign a linked statement of intent, that there were no appeals process and that we could send any questions via email to a generic HR dept email account.

The statement of intent link brought me to a survey (of all things!) that gave me two options 1) agree to come back to the office a certain number of days per month starting in September or 2) to agree to voluntarily resign at the end of the year. 

I know I probably don’t have any legal claim since they didn’t renew my exception. But to make me voluntarily resign? I’m not agreeing to that!

I know in this day and age we cannot expect employers to act in the employees best interest, but when they tell us over and over that we’re Family and they care about us, and then drop this bomb on me, I feel like a schmuck for believing them. I’m a hard worker, a top performer in my group, I’m well liked, and never had any issues with anyone at the company. It just feels like they stabbed me in the back with this impersonal email and survey with no explanations about anything, and no one to go to for any additional details. I emailed the generic mail box with my concerns and have yet to hear back.

I spoke with my manager who didn’t blame me at all for how I felt, but there’s nothing they can do beyond give me as much time as I need to maintain my mental health. I couldn’t focus as all at work today and left early because of the anxiety I’m experiencing.

I’m the breadwinner in my family, we’re underwater on the house we bought two years ago and still have yet to pay off the 401k loan we took out for a down payment. There’s nothing I can do. I can’t afford to pack up my family and move back to where the office is located and I still need to be around for my aging parents.

* I currently have a grievance against him for numerous contract violations. 
* The discrimination department literally opened a case against him that is ongoing.

I work at a multi-million dollar resturant. I work as a waitress/takeout member. Lately the takeout portion hasn't been doing very good, a lot of missed items and call backs. We had a meeting about a month ago to talk about this and how we can improve. At the meeting one of my coworkers mentioned that they're too afraid to talk to management when they miss something or something is wrong because management is always really aggressive and screams at us. The general manager said he'd work on it and bring it up to the other managers. 

Yesterday I made my second ever mistake as of working there for 9 months. I missed a sandwich in an order and the person called back. Immediately I started freaking out because I knew the manager was going to scream at me (not the general manager but an assistant manager). Just as I thought, he came back yelling and screaming at me. He asked how I would feel if someone missed a sandwich in my order, he said I didn't care about my job, he said I wasn't trying, he called me a bad worker, and the entire time was just swearing and cursing me out for being so shitty at my job. He yelled at me for like 5 minutes until I was in tears and crying. Then he grabbed the phone that's literally screwed into the wall, and slammed it against the receiver so hard the entire thing fell out of the wall onto the ground. Then he picked it up, slammed it back onto the wall to try to 'fix it' but when that didn't work he just threw it and started cursing again and walked away. 

Everyone that doesn't work there has told me this is insane behavior. That they shouldn't be allowed to do that and he should be fired. But everyone who works there just says he's 'having a bad day' and I should have done better. I talked to the general manager today about it and his only response was to address the fact I missed a sandwich and not the managers insane behavior. It's like they're trying to play it off and act like it's normal and I'm fucking crazy. I know this isn't normal. The entire thing was caught on a camera. 

I'm just so upset. He kept repeating over and over that I don't care about my job. If I didn't care about my job I wouldn't put up with being treated like this. If I didn't care about my job I would have walked out. He's only saying that because he knows it hurts and gets under my skin. I don't understand how managers can just act like this and get away with it. He's a grown ass 40 year old man, and I'm a teenager. Does it make him feel big and strong to make me cry or something?

  
Early that day before the whole explosion he yelled at me over something that happened before I worked there. When I told him it wasn't me and it wasn't my fault he said it was my fault, it was all of take-outs fault because we never do anything right. I'm so tired of being treated like shit. Every little mistake is met with being belittled until I'm in tears and then they wonder why we don't want to tell them when something goes wrong.  I want to call corporate or someone above my general manager but I don't even think anything will be done. They're just going to sweep it under the rug and say it's my fault because I made my second ever mistake. I don't even know what to do anymore. 

I feel like I'm crazy. I don't know how they can act like this is so casual and normal and it's my fault. "

Dude I am so tired of showing up to work for shit pay and I am homeless and cannot get a better job. Can no longer afford therapy. Boomers’ only solution is to get a second full time job when what we need is actual revolutionary action and the dignity to afford living on one goddamn job no matter how much value it creates or skills it requires. I endure constant mocking of my English degree by illiterate shitheads, a degree which I got because a) it’s my greatest skill and passion, b) in 2013, we were told to get our ticket punched, get a degree any degree, and I got good grades, won scholarships, and had an internship, and c) college transitioned from where people get a (liberal arts) education to being about jobs, of which I thought I could at least do better than cleaning offices like I currently am. “English? What you gonna do with that?”I am losing my fucking mind man. I would just sell my car and start hitchhiking but my job gives me insurance which gives me relatively affordable medication, running out of which I will be in need of medical attention. Capitalism has me by the balls. I see people who have been here cleaning floors for 20 plus years and I wholeheartedly intend to be dead before it comes to that. 
Hundreds of resumes and applications for almost a year and it isn’t even a drop in the bucket. What the fuck is the point?

I think the most logical solution is wean off meds, take up smoking again, move to a shack in a small town in New Mexico or Appalachia, write books, and work part time at a bar or something. 

Something’s gotta give. I make 18/hr after shift differential as a janitor. In 2018, upon graduating college, I made 12/hr as a library supervisor which required a degree. Inflation accounted for and that is the same wage my friends.

My wife is a GM at a gas station owned by an ""investments"" company. They force her to work at least 52hrs a week (salary exempt). Her workers make $10/hr. She's instructed to lie to new hires and tell them they're eligible for a raise at 6-months when they won't be. If there is a call in, she's expected to run the store up to 18hrs a day 7-days a week to cover shifts. Coworkers at overnight stores have worked 36hr+ shifts multiple times. The employees offer to work OT to cover missing employees because she can't keep anyone for $10/hr. They won't let her work anyone over 40hrs because they don't want to pay OT to employees that make $10. Instead, she has to cover the hours. If she does have coverage, she needs to hit that 52/hrs. She's being written up for working 50hrs instead of 52hrs last week even though she consistently cleared 60hrs the few weeks before. They ding her score every month because the paint is cracking on the building. They, in all seriousness, asked her to go buy paint (reimbursement) and paint the building between customers. She's had to bring our infant son to work more than once to cover hours. When other stores can't cover their shifts, she has to cover them as well.  

  
She makes $45,000/yr. Bonuses are promised for meeting goals then taken away for asinine reasons that are made up on the spot (she lost a substantial bonus because a worker miscounted a single pack of cigarettes). 

  
They also don't allow people to be going to college at the same time and fire employees if they find out. They want Their MO is to get people dependent on them so that they're trapped. Managers make just barely enough and are responsible for literally everything. Most of the managers are single mothers.

I'm in Oregon and my employer is a smaller business. Close to 100 employees. I'm scheduled for X time for certain jobs but I'm not actually allowed to go to the job site and clock in for that time. I'm required to wait for a text/call before I can go over. 

I'm not asked to work off the clock. I'm just not allowed to clock in, even though my schedule tells me I work at a set time. 

I've reviewed the laws and I'm just not sure if it's legal or not. My states labor laws feel intentionally vague. It seems like it doesn't count as on-call and they may be exempt from the schedule change laws bc they are a small business. Ma and pops shouldn't be exempt. 

At any rate it's fucking dumb and should be illegal to waste employees time like this. I don't want to make a fuss because not even making ends meet now.

46,2024-07-01,Company ended my contract early and paid for it in spades.,u/Devilotx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dt86vc/company_ended_my_contract_early_and_paid_for_it/,antiwork,"Saw a different post about a contactor holding a client to the terms of their contract over some pastries and that reminded me of my own little tale of holding a company over the fire. 

A few years back, I found myself in the contracting space after being laid off after working for a well known Russian software company, and I was recruited by a bio-tech firm who was looking to revamp their helpdesk.  

I was given a 1 year contract and set out to evaluate what they had and what they would need, and well, I found a nightmare, no ticket SLA, a fractured helpdesk and a ""Sysadmin"" with all certs, no experience who was blowing up AD every other day.  At the end of my first 90 days, I submitted my finding and pretty much advised them to cut 75% of the current staff and replace them with people who could actually do the job.  

The higher ups actually took my action plan to heart and began shedding and replacing the techs, as well as sending my ""Paper Champion"" packing as well.  I picked up what little slack he left behind, and did interviews and replaced the staff with a good set of hardworking, though mostly newbie, techs.  

That being said, the company had a very fractured security setup in regards to the doors, as they had leased a large office in the main complex, and then as they grew, leased 3 other smaller offices to put different departments in.  Now these were all in the same building, but some of them were a good 10+ minute walk away, and for some reason, all 4 offices had different door software, and getting a single PAN card to work on 4 different systems required a convoluted spaghetti system of using different  codes for different systems in order to get that seamless door action that they wanted.  This setup wasn't super hard, but it was super exact, you had to use the correct SN, or portions of the SN depending on the system, and you would need to enable the doors in a particular order or for some reason, some doors would straight up refuse to unlock.  

This was the most annoying part of the job, and when the team was ripped to the frame and then rebuilt, I was the only one they trusted to do it. 

It's now midsummer, and I get an email saying 'COMPANYNAME's big summer outing is here! please reply letting us know how many tickets to ""Awesome farm with rides and games in the area"" you need! up to 8 per family!  Now I've got a wife and 2 kids at home who absolutely love this place, so I immediately reply thanking them and asking for 2 adults and 2 children, that night, I tell the family and they get excited! 

About midday the next day, HR Replies to let me know the ""Good"" news ""I'm sorry Devilotx, this event is for employee's only, You and your family are not invited""  

Like... I get it, Contractors are not employees, but my email is Contractor.devilotx@Companyname, and you sent it to me, to top it off, outside of the MSP techs, I am the ONLY contractor and I've been here a few months now, I know all of you on a first name basis, but ok, I'll break the news to my kids and we'll do something else that day.

Now 8 months into the contract, the entire IT team has been gutted, and rebuilt, with a small inhouse IT team to handle the management and (against my recommendation) a contracted MSP who would send 3-4 techs on site per day.

A few weeks go by, and I'm pulled into a meeting and I'm told that they love what has been done, the team is doing great, and the people I've recommended are not only doing the job right, but 10x faster then the absolute cabbages that were in those positions before, but since the work is winding down, they are going to end my contract early, 2 weeks from that day.  I'm not surprised, they had been transparent that I was just there to fix things, I wouldn't be retained for the position, so I was happy to no longer need to make the commute.  As I wrote up my paperwork and began to catalogue for the CIO I made to sure to let him know that while I had ""documented"" the door setup, it needed to be taught and tested, and someone would need to manage the whole thing.  

That never happened, and 2 days into my final week, they panic, and give me on the contractors to teach, the tech did not care, he did not take notes, he was on his phone the whole time.  I passed the info to the CIO and the next day.  

The next day, the MSP who I trained on the doors, sits down with me to program his first keycard for the day, he doesn't ask any questions, and I have to correct him multiple times, but we get through the first card.  I have to step away, and I ask him to not do anymore cards til I get back. 

I take care of what I need, and I go to get back into the lab and... my badge doesn't work, Well, that was fun, guess I'm getting tossed out a few days early.  I knock on the door to the lab and my guy lets me in, and he's looking pretty damn proud of himself, he tells me that he followed my notes and he's added the cards to 3 out of 4 systems, but the 4th is giving him trouble.  

The fourth is the one that needs to be done 2nd, and this is 10000% why my card doesn't work, he's now blacklisted the entire door database.

He skipped steps, added cards out of order, adding incorrect information, did not backup the database before adding the cards, did not add the cards correctly, basically he couldn't have done more damage even if he had attempted to type the commands with his ass.  

I get authorization for OT, and I set out to restore the 4 doors, luckily there was a backup from the day prior, so only about 16 door cards were lost, plus the 20 or so that were requested today.

The next day (Day before my last day), I come in early for a debrief, I explain the situation and the site manager tells me that he wants to extend my exit date by a couple of weeks, but I am already checked out of this place, I don't like the commute and I'm still smarting from the summer outing thing, so I tell him that I'm not interested in extending the contract as is, but I would be willing to amend it to stay on.   I tell the site manager that I would require $15 more an hour, permission to take interviews on company time no more than twice a week with the caveat that the contract can run until either they no longer require my services, or I am hired in a full time capacity here or elsewhere. 

I was told that there was no way they would do that, and I said ""Well, tomorrow is my last day so, good luck""

On my last day, I was finishing my final tasks and the CIO came to say goodbye, and he commented that he knew they were trying to retain me for a bit longer, but that I had told them there was no way for me to stay.

I laughed and told him that wasn't true, reiterated my terms, and he asked if I was serious, I confirmed that I would require that in order to stay past today.  

More meetings with HR, the CIO and a few other involved people and my terms were accepted, I returned to the office on Monday morning and was met with a very angry site manager who saw me going to the CIO as going over his head, I didn't care, but I did advise him that per the terms, I would be leaving at 1pm for an interview somewhere else. 

Needless to say, I had that interview, landed that job and put in my 2 week notice that friday.

I spent the next week training the CIO how to configure the doors, and by the following Friday, I was gone.

I may not have been able to cash in big, but I got enough back for me."

15,2024-07-01,Exploitation is wrong,u/Moonjinx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dt8d5w/exploitation_is_wrong/,antiwork,"I got in an argument with a family member and they don’t think I’m serious about this point, so I’m putting this out there for all to see:

It doesn’t matter if your 16, 26, or 96: exploitation is wrong.

So what if the teenager doesn’t need that much money to live? So what if they blow their wages meant to support a family on fancy cars and TVs? It used to be a high school graduate could pay their way through college. I hear lots of old folks brag about this fact. But it doesn't happen anymore. Setting aside the many factors that have contributed to the inflated costs of college, even if we took those all away, a young adult today could not afford to pay for college on minimum wage. Living costs alone eat up the money they earn.

Exploitation pits different levels of labor against each other to profit the corporations. Why should I hire the 26 year old with a wife and two kids, when I can hire the 16 year old who doesn’t know his worth and pay him pennies? Why should I hire the 46 year old with 30 years of experience when the 26 year old is chomping at the bit for a chance to prove himself at a much lower wage?

Exploitation is wrong. Why would you teach your teen that they should be expected to be exploited in this way? Why would you allow someone to shortchange their salary? Simply because they “don’t need it”? How much of a salary is acceptable for a teen? How is that decided? I have a distant family member who pays his own children $4 to do HARD labor. I’m not talking mowing lawns, I’m talking skilled trade, construction work. Why is that okay?! Because they’re learning?!

What about the teens who do need a living wage? The ones who are trying to raise their siblings because they suddenly became orphaned? The ones who are trying to escape their abusive family members, but they’re trying to do so discreetly? Or how about the ones who you claim don’t need it, but are rather responsible, upstanding citizens who just want a good start? They have already figured out budgeting, but can’t get a decent wage because they’re a teenager, and we as a society have decided they’re “not worth” a living wage? WHO DECIDED WHAT IS A GOOD WAGE FOR A TEENAGER TO BEGIN WITH?!?

EXPLOITATION. IS. WRONG. And if you think it’s okay to pay teenagers slave wages, you’re a sick bastard who needs therapy. It is possible to calculate a base wage that is needed for someone to survive, and that wage should change with the economic factors that surround an individual community. Why are we excluding teenagers from being included from this base wage?

I don’t care if this doesn’t take traction. You will never convince me that this isn’t wrong, and I will take this stance to my grave. IF YOU CANT AFFORD TO PAY ANYONE A LIVING WAGE, YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS. How and if they squander that wage is not your concern, and they will pay the price for it. 

If there are factors making it hard for you to pay a living wage, then maybe you should narrow those down and focus your anger at the institutions keeping you down rather than the individuals trying to earn a living.  Be warned though, sometimes the answer to your business fiscal woes is looking at you in the mirror.

To all the pricks that argue about “robots and computers” taking over jobs:

A) Those are hella expensive, and really risky. 

B) I already make an effort to boycott any business I encounter that tries this. I don’t eat at any fast food places known for this. No, I don’t use Uber eats or use the app. I walk in and pay for my meal to make sure a living person is getting paid. And I worked call centers, I can tell when you’re not paying someone to take my call. Many a business has lost my business over this, and I do make a point to tell them.

C) I’m tired of this threat, make use of it and prove machines are superior already. It’s not like I can stop you, and you’ve proven you’re going to do it anyway.

I also realize this is a first world picture of a much bigger problem. I'm willing to sit down at the global table and talk this stuff out and work out a system where everyone is paid decently. I would also gladly hand over the criminals who exploit children in other countries if I knew they would actually face justice. Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of influence. As it is, I already boycott Nestle, and other companies that come to light in this matter as much as I can to do my part where I can."

I thought little of it at the time but I recently learned that a new manager at my wife's place of work is married to that manager and has been talking about what he has said to her about me and revealed that he has been spreading lies to me at least to her regarding my performance and punctuality at my former workplace. Right now I'm using a friend, who happens to be a manager that is unaffiliated with the store or any parties involved besides myself, to confirm whether or not he is telling potential employers these lies as well.

  
However given that this isn't a real job offer that would be denied as a result of this I'm not sure what I can do to prove damages for a defamation suit against this former boss. I don't know if other bosses I have made applications to would be willing to disclose what he has said to them, particularly with him not a reference but as employment history, or how I could convince them to divulge this if he did indeed lie about my time there. Any advice on how I should proceed should I discover through my friend (who will be recording the exchange for me) that he is in fact lying about me to potential employers?"

I was REALLY good at what I did, to the point that debtors who had been problems for years when they came across my screen and I talked to them and helped dive into their problems, never became an issue again.  I basically believed in giving people a chance, and if we needed to rework a loan, I advocated for the customer.  The thought process I had was; ""Hey guys, do we really want to waste thousands of dollars calling these people every month and perpetuate the cycle or do we want to get people back on track?""  

Apparently those delinquency numbers going down was a huge problem.  My boss hired someone who came from a commercial real estate background to help process legal paperwork, and this person made no bones about the fact that she didn't mind cutting corners and having zero ethics.  Within the first week she brought up to the department manager that there was a loophole in state law that as long as you could verify someone was a property owner, you could start the legal process at 21 days past due.  There was barely time for us to get a few calls into people before she wanted to start the lawsuit process, and it became a matter of policy that on the second call to the member that we had to do a GIS search for property.  I made it very clear that I would NOT be participating in that because while it might not be illegal, it was unethical and morally wrong.  

About three months in to this new policy, I get brought into a meeting with my supervisor and the department manager.  It began with; ""We have a problem.""  To which I said; ""Oh?  How can I be of assistance?""  My supervisor said; ""The problem is you refuse to follow department policy on verifying property ownership on the second call.""  To which I responded with; ""Yeah.  Because our credit union has a reputation for being honest and working with people.  I mean...that's literally what our advertisements say.""  ""Well, we need to start getting more money in from lawsuits.""  ""Why?""  ""Because you've cost us money in fees and daily compounded interest from getting accounts back on track.""  I pondered that for a moment and said; ""I'm sorry, but isn't it our duty to protect our members from massive bad debt write offs?  Isn't getting accounts in good standing doing exactly that?""  The department manager retorted with; ""I am going to authorize two additional weeks of vacation for you, I've already put in for it.  You will be off starting Monday.  If you decide you can't do this job, let us know when you come back and we will find something else for you at the credit union to do.""  I said; ""Sounds great!""

What do you guys think I did?  In the two weeks I was out I had a ton of interviews.  I called my boss on the Friday before I was supposed to be back and asked her if it was OK if I came in to work on Saturday because I was feeling great about my job and knew I could do it.  She replied with; ""Come on in!""  I worked Saturday, and after everyone left, I cleaned my desk out and sent off my resignation letter effective immediately.

Monday morning both the supervisor and department manager were blowing up my phone thinking I was joking with them.  And then the reality set in that not only did they give me two weeks of free vacation...because I came in on Saturday and worked...they had to pay out the rest of my PTO balance.  The credit union was small enough that the CEO knew everyone by name and was the type that came by and gave out birthday cards and your annual anniversary bonus/gift.  As soon as I confirmed my PTO balance in my paycheck that Friday, I hit send on an email I had drafted to him explaining why I had left.  

The supervisor and department manager didn't last long.  Not sure how the guy who was the VP of the entire area survived, but he did.  Oh and the person that they brought on that suggested all of this garbage?  Yeah...she lasted long enough to have to file all of the paperwork to drop all of the lawsuits that she had helped file and process refunds to everyone that was sued...then she got canned too.  It feels nice to win one for the little guys."

One day, I screwed up and had a bad day that the manager accused me of being bad instead of having a bad day. I literally was crying inside at home.

2)Somehow doing the exact same procedure in closing at the home location but different location means I will never work at that location ever again. But I get to keep my job.

3)I do be the son of immigrants, but I can’t stand people with bad language skills. Most of the customers who fall into this realm have zero English. This means they can’t say things properly or it is difficult to understand.

It has been around 7 months since he joined the firm. His lunch hours were from 13:30 hours to 14:20 hours until a month back.

So last month the organisation rolled in a rule that the lunch hours have been rescheduled as 13:30 hours till 14:10 hours and an employee needs to log back on their device by 14:15 hours max or penalties will be levied.

The firm has its office on 10th floor of a building. So if a person needs to eat their lunch from a local eateries (as its not possible for most people to carry homemade lunch), they’d have to spare 10-12 minutes on average to go down and then come up. The eateries have a waiting time as well as they are generally crowded during lunch hours.

My brother who failed to login by 14:15 hours 4 days last month got his salary deducted by 8% of his Basic Pay. Some of his co workers were penalised by 20-24%.

A couple of weeks ago, I stood up to my manager, and he started punishing me ever since by restricting the contracts I usually get. Things have come to a head, and finally, it happened—I quit. I couldn’t take it anymore. My hard work and dedication were never appreciated, and in my time of need, I was simply cast aside.

Now, I’m examining the ruins of this recent event and realizing I don’t have anything to show for it. As I said, it was a dead-end job. If anything, I think I am worse off than before. My confidence and hope for life have been shattered. I want to recover and find a way to happiness, but every new challenge just feels like an inevitable failure.

It truly feels unfair the way I was treated, but there is nothing I can do. The lesson was clear to me yet again: there is a power structure, and if you know what’s good for you, you say “yes, sir.”

I'm a pretty new member in this community and I've never felt more at home. Since this is my first post I'm sorry if i'm wording myself badly. Also I'm from Sweden so english isn't my first language.

Anyways, gonna try to keep this somewhat short.
So I'm currently unemployed since the beginning of 2024 and I'm looking for jobs on a daily basis. I used to work at a warehouse for 7 years, I liked the job until they made some major changes and I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I'm presumably looking for a new job at a warehouse, but heres the problem. I can't fucking stand working 8 hours a day. My feet, body, head.. yes everything starts to fucking hurt after around the 5 hour mark. I'm also struggling hard with depression/anxiety and I'm currently undergoing a neuropsychiatric investigation (ah shit idk if that's the right word in english? I hope google did it for me haha)
So yeah not only does it kill me physically but moreso mentally because of my diagnoses.

So I've decided that 6hrs a day for my next job is a must for me and my health. And I'm okay with a lower pay, I always put my health and freetime first. But of course I need to ask about shorter workdays since 8hrs is the standard. But what do I say to the manager? Since they would obviously want a reason I guess... I just know if i'm being honest about me presumably suffering from ADHD/Autism/Bipolar disorder they won't even think about employing me, so is there anything else I can say that they will ""be okay with""? And I'm okay with lying if that's whats needed. 

Or do you think they would be just fine with me working less hours from the start? Reason why I'm asking this is because at my previous job I got reduced hours by own demand, but I worked there for 7 years so I was pretty comfortable asking for that."

Being stuck in a 30 year mortgage is absolutely comical and pure comedy. They don't really expect people to pay that off on a 50 or 70k salary. You'll be a slave to that job and put up with abuse so you don't lose your job but in the end you'll endup with a layoff or get fired for random reasons. And meanwhile you get 1% riases that will basically do nothing and also not to mention if you endup with expensive repairs you'll never afford them. 


There is even cases where if you stay in a company for too long you become too ""expensive"" to keep. 

The thoughts that bothered me alot lately is that even if I was the department head in my company making like 100-150k it will still take me an absurd amount of time to pay off an average home (avg homes in california are 500k] Possibly years of aggressive saving. Meanwhile there are some fools who blow 500k on a car. I always wondered why I never cross path with these people till I did one day in the gym and realized one important thing. They don't go to the same places we do. They don't work average jobs. They may not be even jobs, some just live off investments and rentals and interest rates. 1 million dollar in the bank will generate 50k in interest  which is enough for bills and an average lifestyle if you don't work. 


The mentality of these people is a whole different level. He basically tells me he will rather kill himself rather than work for someone. But also he was so far out of touch with reality. He thought the economy is doing excellent. There are thousands of jobs. He have no idea how bad is it out there to have a job because he didn't have one for a very long time.  He has 40 rental units and lives off then income they generate. Pretty much a leach in society that contributes nothing. The thing is that he created a lifestyle out of being a leach. Traveling and fancy cars and never ever having to work. 


He also thinks that him offering his workers 12/hr isn't labor exploitation but more like creating jobs and opportunities for them and they chose to take it... not only that but also they should be grateful. 

I really didn't know what to say because even though he is an asshole but he is right from a bussiness owner perspective. We need workers that are paid so little so we can keep more money. Makes sense. 

Im so fedup with the world but especially rich people who are completely out of touch with reality. They are simply choosing to ignore the reality.

She called me a couple weeks ago, asking If I wanted to move to the upper floor, which is not as nice, and really dim with tiny windows. I said I didn’t, and I thought that was the end of it. 

Fast forward to today, I overhear her saying we’re moving upstairs to another coworker, and I get the news like that. Then she tells me to come upstairs to take a look. While we walk, I ask if this is at all negotiable, she says that no one is forcing us, and that it’s what she wants.

I try to explain to her how I already enjoy when I’m seated, and how our current room has more light. She dismisses me, explaining how moving will help productivity, because there’s people we work with on the upper floor, which is actually not true as I work with people in the lower floor as well. 


She starts getting defensive, saying this is what she wants, asking why I’m arguing, and walks away while I’m still talking. 

For context, I work in tech. and I have 2 work from home days per week. As does everyone on different days, so being in the office is not detrimental to work, neither is where your desk is, as everyone uses Zoom for meetings.

I was manipulated for 2 years by this company as a contractor by them using the promise of converting to full-time. Every 6 months I would get extended but never converted, and the pay stayed the same while I had to work extra hard just so I get renewed every 6 months with the promise of maybe eventually getting converted. My health insurance cost went from 200 a month to 600. 

Of course, with no raise to pay this increase. I am uninsured starting this month because I can't pay the insurance and I'm not entitled to employee benefits because I'm in contract.

Which leads me to this post:

I had to cancel the health insurance. I looked for other health insurances but all of the enrollment periods have ended. I tried short term health insurances and got denied because I have a pre-existing condition. Basically I don't have options, nor a qualifying life event that enables me to enroll now. I have to wait until next year to get insured and hope I don't get a flare up of my heart condition. 

This job has taken everything away from me and I have absolutely no reason to keep working. No pay, no benefits, no health insurance. Yet I am expected to do everything and finish all of my work before they let me go later in the year."

From what I've seen, based on other job ads, they are the lowest-paying employer for this particular field in the area. I was just offered a job at a much-better paying employer, so today I'm going to give notice to my boss.

The question is, what is the best way to word this? Obviously the reason is ""better pay,"" but I want to make it clear that it's not just a matter of the new place paying more, but of the fact that this current place absolutely does not pay enough. When I first started here, I tried to get an apartment, and applied to the cheapest apartment in the area. They looked at my paystub and saw that my rent would be about half of my take-home pay, and declined to rent to me.

This is a job that requires a Master's degree, so it's ridiculous that they don't pay enough for me to rent a cheap apartment. When I tell my boss why I'm leaving, I don't want to be an asshole, but I would like to make it very clear that they do not pay a liveable wage and that's why I'm leaving. (I should add that I'm married, but I'm the breadwinner in the relationship. We are currently living with his mother.)

Of course, my immediate boss probably doesn't have any say in the employee salary, and I'm guessing that the higher-ups already know that the salary is low. Still, I would like to make it explicitly clear that the reason I am leaving is because I can't even afford an apartment on what they are paying me. What is a nice, non-asshole way to phrase this?"

I am starting to hate working for them. His wife is a bit intolerable in that she complains about everything and micro-manages. She doesn't really know anything about dental front office, so when they first opened and hired me, I set up the system we use for scheduling, got paperwork and templates made, got in network with insurances, made the training manual, etc. 

But she does things that drive me absolutely crazy sometimes. For example, if you are on the phone with a patient and she is listening in on it, she'll keep telling you what to say from the side, or tries to correct what you are saying. ALWAYS. She also complains about the back office and how inefficient they are, meanwhile the assistants are hardly ever able to take a lunch, they normally work through it and starve the entire shift. Doctor tends to over schedule patients, and it leaves us running behind a lot, or without break in between patients.

When I've called out before because I was sick, they would tell me I have to come in because his wife has an event or sports thing with their kids and she can't be in the office and there was no one else at the front except me. Or now that we have added another person in the front, they talk shit when someone calls out and start rambling about, ""I never called out when I worked, I would put on my big girl pants and just work."" But she leaves the office constantly for her kids while the rest of us come in early or stay late if needed when a dental case runs late.

Don't get me wrong, they are very nice and sweet although at times it is very two-faced. They are pretty accomadating too, and I get paid well. If I need to come in early, they are happy to work with me if the schedule allows. 

The doctor also comes to the front all the time to complain about the small things that go wrong, even if we've done 100 things right. For example, he came to the front the other day and goes, ""I had to change the schedule and a few of the appointments because no one ever comes to ask me how I want the schedule to look so I just changed it."" And he tells us he doesn't like having to repeat himself and wants his employees to do things right the first time it is asked. But he changes his mind on how things are run all the time, so it's hard to keep up...

Another thing is that doctor and his wife will fight in the office at times, or she'll tell us to do something and not tell him, so it puts us in a very awkward position. 

All of these things have just kind of built up, and i'm starting to resent it here. I am applying to other places, but I might get paid a few dollars less an hour. Do you think it's worth it? Am I just overthinking this? I've been going back and forth for a couple months now."

Some of them interview me but then send me a follow up saying “we have moved forward with someone who is qualified more” like wtf? Then why waste my time interviewing me if you already have other candidates that you know would have more qualifications etc? Or that they gave the position to someone who is already employed with their company. Makes no since.
Feel like my time is just being wasted. I am applying to jobs I’m qualified for even over qualified for & prepare for interviews. My resume is great.
 Nothing matters I guess. I am so stressed & frustrated.

I pride myself in being the (millennial manager). I tend to be super relaxed and try to have as much fun as possible as we all hate being there.

Anyway I got the bate and switch where I was told the pay and they docked it by 2 bucks when I signed it. It was hidden in small letters on the paper. (I was to exhausted after all the stress from the last job and didn't read it full). Our general manager and merchandise manager are lazy and talk shit about the minimum wage employees on almost a constant. And my main issue is I was told the training was on site in the interview and now I'm being told I need to wake up tomorrow morning at 4am to drive 1 and a half hours to another city for training for the rest of the week (again this was NOT what I was told when accepting the job) they will not be paying me for the drive either which is going to eat my last check just for the gas alone. 

Add to all of this they told me the reason the last ASM left was to further his career and now I'm being told they have gone through 7 ASMs in 3 months (me being the 8th).

The interview was fantastic and I didn't see any red flags until I got in. Not even 2 days in and Im debating heavily to just not drive tomorrow and rely on my freelance and DoorDash until I can find something better.

0,2024-07-02,Received hate messages from co-workers and their friends for not participating in staff boycott.,u/reiveisti,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dtt28m/received_hate_messages_from_coworkers_and_their/,antiwork,"I'm not really familiar with boycott culture. I work at a well-known coffee chain in South Korea, and here, resigning without notice or refusing to work can seriously damage your chances of getting hired elsewhere. You could end up with a bad reputation for sabotaging a company's operations—something I've heard from more experienced staff and adults.

Every month, the company's finance department does an inventory stock check. This month, the stock and inventory didn't match, so management decided to deduct 50,000KRW (about $50 from each FnB department staff member's salary). In total, this was around $600 (12 staffs including the cafe manager and supervisor), which is twice the value of the missing items. My co-workers thought this was unfair and decided to boycott today.

We have a separate group chat for co-workers, and I told them I couldn't participate in the boycott. It's my first job, and I didn't want to ruin my reputation and make it hard to find another job. Many jobs rejected me because of my age and inexperience. The co-worker who created the group chat said some mean things about me and removed me right away. They were understandably emotional, and when they called me selfish and a traitor, I didn't take it to heart. I just said I'm sorry.

Yesterday, my co-workers came to work as a group, handed in their resignation forms and uniforms at the HR desk, caused a scene, and left without giving HR a chance to talk to them. I had to cover a double shift because there were no other baristas left. If I had left, the cafe couldn't have operated. That day, I was promoted from barista to cafe supervisor for the vacant position with a salary raise. They told me i performed a lot better than their expectations and deserved the position even though I told them I'm not confident. They told me they'd support me. I was happy but also unprepared for the sudden jump in responsibilities, stress, and the unexpected backlash. Maybe I'm overthinking too much but it's making me feel really anxious and stressed, I'm still a university student.

The next day, my former co-workers and their friends started sending me hate messages, calling me an opportunist and a traitor, even accusing me of sleeping with the boss for the job and promotion because they said they notice the boss favors me a lot which is untrue. Boss leaves the same amount of tips to everyone whenever he visits and maybe he is a bit more friendlier to me when we speak because of my personality but that's just about it.  I didn't respond and blocked everyone, deactivated my account, and took a break from social media.

What should I do in this situation? I don't want to bring this issue to HR because I feel like it'd cause more trouble."

I've been trying to apply at various firms, but they were low-key crap. One seemed to be busy, stressful and poor work-life balance. The other had tedious probationary period conditions. 

I gave up for a while, but now I'm on a PIP. I was looking earlier because HR pulled me aside for ""getting up too many times from my desk"". And then I got transferred to a team that has been difficult with me. I tried to ""manage up"" and get clearer directions, but this I believe actually contributed to my PIP. 

I think part of the reason I'm being targeted is because I have a medical condition. I try to keep it private since at my last firm I was discriminated against for having cancer, but now that I am getting fired in less than 60 days, I think it's inevitable now, and I will have to start asking for accommodations. 

One of the reasons I liked this job was for the hours flexibility and 2 days of hybrid WFH days. Now, I have to come in exactly from 7:30 to 5:30 on office days. Usually, I come in 10 minutes late to even an hour when my chronic pain or energy is really bad, but I always stay an hour late to make up for the lost time. They aren't offering me this anymore. 

I also get up from my desk a lot because I get headaches, allergies, and also I have an overactive bladder that I've seen a doctor for. They still haven't been able to resolve it or find any reason for it. I did give my HR a doctors note so that I wouldn't have to worry about being bullied about it. 

**TL;DR** 

How can I get a job without worrying about being discriminated because I use the restroom or my energy problem/sleep disorder/thyroid cancer affecting quality of energy. "

Advice please! ,u/Ok_Conversation_9737,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dtxopa/what_am_i_doing_wrong_advice_please/,antiwork,"Im struggling really badly at my current job. Im looking for a different job but not having luck. I'm a 43 year old woman who is fat. I also have a disease like lupus, fibromyalgia and moderate rheumatoid arthritis so I struggle with pain, exhaustion and other physical issues. However I give it my ALL at my job. I save my spoons for work and bust my ass and then collapse at home. I work at a fast casual restaurant that is like Moe's or Chipotle but Chinese food. Everyone I work with is also at least 10 years younger than me, most 20 years younger than me and almost everyone is thin and fit. Also they do not wear masks and I always mask up due to my autoimmune disease. 

I started at this restaurant last year and it's been... Rough.  I have 7 years of restaurant management experience, and applied for a job that was listed a manager opening, $15 an hour to start plus tips. (That's really good for a restaurant in my area) In the interview I was told they do not hire in managers. Everyone has to start as crew and typically after 60 days if they have done all their training they can start moving through the different levels of management. Then I was told they start everyone at $12.00 an hour not $15. I pushed for the $15 in the ad based on my experience and managed to BARELY get $13.00 an hour. 
 
I had no other decent options at that time, it's common for $12 an hour to be listed as a ""good"" wage in my area even in healthcare and office jobs unless you are in a position like lawyer or upper management. So I accepted the job, figuring that with my experience I'd move up quickly. My first day I am told that because I started at a higher wage then they usually pay, I ""owe"" every bit of that difference back to the company so I would not get any increase for the first four $0.25 cent raises I would normally get during my first 60 days while I learned the stations.  

Then they hired in 3 other people as managers at $15 an hour despite 2 of them having less experience then me. They are both younger and way thinner than me however. I started in prep and learned it very quickly, and pretty much took over as head prep within two weeks of starting. I started training other people in prep, (no promotion or raise) and I am one of the fastest prep people they have, among several locations. I am also one of the only employees at my store that knows how to do all prep items. So I felt like I was a good employee and do a good job. 

However, this job has ""positive"" write ups. Basically anyone can ""write"" you up for being good. Like if you do extra cleaning without being asked, or help someone out, or whatever anyone catches you doing that is good, they can give you a write up and post it on the bulletin board. I have received only ONE the entire 9 months I have been there, and it was my first week, for learning prep so fast. Since then I have never gotten one again. No matter what I do that is above and beyond. Literally every other employee gets multiple positive write ups a week. 

I have not been trained on all stations yet, even though I was supposed to be trained by 90 days. I see everyone else new come in and get trained and 9 months in I still am not. Which means I cannot move into management and I don't qualify for a raise yet. While I see 17 year old highschool kids become managers and get raises. 

I also get complaints from managers, but never to my face, they always bring these complaints up in the weekly manager meetings. The GM won't name names so I don't know who is complaining. I'm just told ""some of the managers"" are bringing up complaints with me. The complaints seem bizarre to me but based on how I'm being treated overall I'm wondering if maybe I am just really way over confident in my performance? I have never had issues like this *anywhere* else I've worked. I have excelled at my former jobs. But maybe since Covid my self perception is skewed? 

The complaints so far are:

1) (three months ago, to the former GM) one day on my normal Thursday 9 am to 4 pm shift (minus 30 minutes for our daily meeting/lunch break) I worked 9 am to 4 pm. I had 5 things to prep that day and did double batches of some of it, and then cleaned my station and went home like usual. But for some reason that one specific day the managers felt I should have been done before 4 and they complained that I worked my full shift... But they complained a full week later ... To the GM. They didn't say anything during my shift. 

Immediately after that complaint IN THE SAME SENTENCE I was also informed that 

2) The day before the GM talked to me, I had had very little prep and finished early, so the manager in charge that shift said I could go early. But for some reason that day some other managers felt I should have taken longer and they complained that I DIDN'T work my full shift. Again, nobody said anything to me and I was TOLD to go home to cut labor. 

Now yesterday I got more complaints from the brand new GM, again from ""some managers"" 

3) I sometimes take what they think is ""too long"" to prep veggies. I don't even prep veggies every day, some weeks I don't prep veggies at all. I also am one of the fastest people in the entire company at prepping them. The amount we prep also changes from day to day. Some days I can only prep 4 trays of watercress and 6 trays of carrots. Other days I have to prep 8 trays of watercress, 12 trays of carrots, and 8 trays of broccoli. So prep times can vary drastically. I literally don't know how I could prep them any faster than I already do... Plus that complaint is so vague? ""Sometimes"" I take what they *think* is ""too long""?

And the last complaint 

4) I sometimes take ""too many"" bathroom breaks and spend ""a long time"" in the bathroom. The most I have ever used the bathroom in one day was 4 times in an 8 hour shift and my IBS was acting up. Most days I use the bathroom 1-2 times per shift. Occasionally 3 times if it's very hot and I drink a lot. I work 6-8 hours each shift, and I didn't think that was a lot of bathroom breaks. I also have bad kidneys from my autoimmune disease and kinda can't hold it longer than that. As for the ""long time"" I'm at the bathroom anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes. Sometimes there is a line for the bathroom, sometimes I have to poo, so it takes a few minutes. But even when I take 10 full minutes, that includes taking my apron off and storing it in the apron station, walking across the restaurant, going through doors, going to the bathroom hallway, using the bathroom, washing my hands, walking back, washing hands again, getting my apron and putting it back on and going back to my station. I... I don't think I'm the one who is in the wrong here, at least in this situation. 

So because I never get any positive write ups and have all these complaints, I'm on warning that anymore complaints mean my hours get cut. I'm barely making ends meet and I can't afford it. What am I doing wrong?? I am at a loss. I'm kind, friendly to everyone, I've baked cookies for Christmas for everyone who had to work Christmas Eve, I help out wherever needed, take pride in my job, don't waste time, I don't steal time from the company by leaning in slow times, I find stuff to clean. I show up with a good attitude, I hustle, I train others, and I do my best. Not one manager ever says anything to my face about these issues, only behind my back. To my face they all praise me and say I'm ""killing it"" or I'm the ""GOAT"" and telling me I'm doing great. 

I'm at a loss. Until I find another job I HAVE to make this work. What am I doing wrong and how do I fix this?

I resigned from my job last week to work in not my ideal industry, but knowing it will keep me sane until I get something better. 

My department was basically 2 groups: Club Mom for women who despite being in their mid-40s, don't know how to function outside of a sorority and their recent graduate proteges - women in their early 30s working their 1st job out of college as department directors (seriously...HOW?!) 

The only coworker who didn't subscribe to the mobbing, gossip, and groupthink left months ago (gee, I wonder why). There were 3 people in my role for less than a year before me (hmm...)

I still did my best to get along and get to know my colleagues without becoming a mean girl, and it went as expected. If middle school taught me anything, if you are the 'other', then you're everyone's target.  

In one instance, I expressed to my boss and coworker that I was struggling with unresponsive managers to which my boss responded, ""well, we don't have to respond to you."" They both had a good giggle, I said nothing. Sure, you don't have to respond but please don't ask me why something isn't done if that's your attitude. 
My coworkers would frequently no show or cancel meetings with me, to which I was always flexible and understanding. Again, fine if you reschedule but please don't ask me why a task is taking longer to complete. It was obviously a game, but I wasn't going to play. 

So my last week, I double booked and skipped meetings with my coworkers. The nasty, passive aggressive emails that ensued were worth it and didn't hurt anymore. 
Even more fun, I somehow got blamed for ""ruining"" a baby shower because I didn't write 3 sentences on a Word document. Suddenly, they knew how to respond and meetings were *very important to our team and communication*. 

Wait, I thought we didn't have to respond to each other?  Tee hee! Sorry, I guess I missed rush week. :) "

It was mid afternoon, broad daylight, no one was really out. This homeless guy was clearly mentally disabled in someway but not high. He kept wandering in confused and asking for people who weren’t there. I would’ve called 911 and just had him taken in for a psych eval. The bartender yelled at him and kicked him out but the homeless guy came back and was wandering out front so the bartender leaned out the door and screamed at him a bunch of stuff like “go F off and die, no one wants you” and a bunch more. The guy turned around and weakly kicked in the direction of the bartender who said that gave him cause to: punch this homeless man to the ground, hold him face down by the throat and punch him in the head repeatedly “until he stopped fighting”. The staff and customers cheered them on for the most part and THEN someone called 911. The homeless guy, who was maybe 5’7 got arrested and the 6’2 bartender pressed charges. It took a while because the homeless man couldn’t pass the competency hearings but eventually he took a lesser charge. 

The employers never trained their staff in person on how to handle emergencies like this but it was in the handbook they signed when they started to call a manager. Nothing happened to the employee except I heard they were written up. The owners then gave them a gift worth about 2k. Staff complained about working with this employee and feeling unsafe and the bartender made multiple jokes about beating up anyone else who caused issues. 

I feel like the owners were liable here since their bartender panicked and went outside to beat up a confused homeless person. He said he blacked out and doesn’t even remember doing it. I feel like the owners should’ve trained better for this or at least talked to them and retrained the staff afterwards so they  felt safer in the future. Multiple people felt like it should be reported somewhere but didn’t know who or where to go since the police had already been involved and no one wanted to lose their job.

I have a stack of reimbursements that I haven’t been able to get submitted all year. Now undoubtedly I share the blame because I didn’t necessarily aggressively follow up on these, but in my defense, my workload here is consistently at least twice what I’m able to do as one person. I tend to be really efficient and am able to carry a heavy workload, so draw your own conclusions there.

In any case, my supervisor insists that reimbursements get done on ""Form A."" So I prep them, she reviews them, signs them, and I send them over. Accounts Payable says people from this funding stream get reimbursed via ""Form B.""

So when I have time (see paragraph 1), I convert these to Form B and bring them in to the supervisor. She doesn’t understand why they’re on this type of form. I say I don’t know, it’s just what they asked for so I put it together. She says no, that’s not right, go talk to them again.

So I do. The answer is the same.

So I go back to my supervisor. She says I’ve got to look out when talking to XYZ because she talks you around in circles and supervisor doesn’t understand what she’s saying. She says these people are definitely in the right funding stream to be reimbursed by Form A. Go back and check on it again.

It went back and forth like this all year. Yes, year. Some of these literally go back to last June. She wouldn’t listen to me about what I was supposed to do, and that didn’t change what form Accounts Payable would accept.

Eventually, finally, she decided to contact Accounts Payable herself. She was able to email someone that I guess she’s willing to believe. Guess what? They go on Form B. Just like I’ve been told and have been saying this whole time!

This is what my job is like all. the. time. It’s infuriating. She doesn’t respect me enough to listen to my answers, but she sends me out to ask them anyway.

Plus, anything whatsoever that is being submitted, she insists on personally reviewing before it goes. Even if she’s not the signatory. So there was no way around this without it biting me sometime later.

I have stuck around because I love everything else about this job, and I’m part of a program that includes automatic promotions the first two years. I thought I had to stay till next February to qualify to transfer for a promotion. I just found out today that is not the case. 

Now the only thing keeping me here is the fact that she's the only thing causing me problems. I really love this job but it is not good for me. 

I’ve been going through this for two and a half years.

339,2024-07-03,Being able to access employment is arguably harder now for neurodivergent/cognitively impaired people than it used to be,u/simple-misery,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1du5fl0/being_able_to_access_employment_is_arguably/,antiwork,"I was discussing this in an autism group the other day. The topic was ""why are there so many more autistic people now than there used to be"" 

One of the responses was: there aren't, we're just more aware of the condition and able to better access assesment and diagnosis. But I also brought up another reason that led to an important discussion. Simply put, life, in certain ways, is harder now than it was back in the 50s and 60s and when life gets especially difficult for neurodivergent people, the effects are more noticeable. In a world that is louder, busier and brighter than ever before, people start to realize how sensitive they are to it all, they start to notice issues in themselves that other people don't seem to struggle with.

Work plays a HUGE part in this. It used to be easier for people with developmental disabilities to get jobs that were decently suited to them that paid enough to support themselves and even a family. These days its a long, stressful process to even get a single interview and the current interview process is very intense and many companies expect people to go through SEVERAL rounds of interviews before they even consider a candidate.

My grandparents aren't officially diagnosed with anything, but most of their children and grandchildren are. You can see neurodevelopmental conditions all over my family tree and my grandmother's autism and OCD is especially apparent. But none of this mattered when they were young. My grandfather got a job as a garbage man and made wooden puzzles as a hobby. My grandmother turned her special interest into a job by breeding exotic cats for show. They were able to make enough of a living that they were comfortable, with little stress and could afford to raise three kids. They didn't even need any schooling to get their jobs. They retired before 65 and got to spend the rest of their lives being developmentally impaired but comfortable, and having the time and money to focus even more on their special interests.

My mom and her siblings (who have been officially diagnosed with autism, ocd, bipolar)also didn't need to struggle very much in the 80s to get interviews and find employment. My mentally disabled mother was able to walk into a job fair and get hired on the spot just because the employer liked her response to the question ""what kind of person would you describe yourself as"" to which she replied ""a happy one.""

Meanwhile, I'm 30 and have had to jump through a multitude of hoops just to land an interview of which the questions often seem designed to weed people like me out. Interviews are hard on autistic people, but they don't need to be SO hard. There used to be a time where someone with lower cognitive abilities could walk into a grocery store and walk out with a job as a grocery bagger and that would actually pay them enough to live a somewhat normal life. Now its become harder and harder just to get a low skilled, low paid job and since these are often the only jobs cognitively disabled people can do, its no wonder so many people are on disability or living on the streets. 

I hate the stigma around disabilities and employment. Time and time again we hear things like ""if you can type, you can work"", ""if you can use a computer, you can get a job"" 
When the reality is a lot more complicated than that. There is resentment towards disabled people who don't work and live off of government aid, but so many people fail to realize just how astonishingly difficult its become for disabled to get jobs. 

Anyway. I'm done ranting. If you're a disabled person who has the same frustrations as I do, please vent here. "

10,2024-07-03,panda express took my soul and all i did was interview !!! ,u/Friendly_Buddy_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1du5tlp/panda_express_took_my_soul_and_all_i_did_was/,antiwork,"
sorry… this is going to be LONG. i am just so baffled and exasperated i can’t believe this is how this company is run. 

i was scouted through indeed, a recruiter asked me to come to an open interview. i have 8 years experience managing a very large, popular fast food chain that is a lead competitor. 

i came in for the interview asking for a shift lead position. after 30 minutes of talking solely about my past company position, i was asked, “you have a lot of experience and are very qualified, is there any chance you would be willing to interview for assistant manager?” i said yes because they offered to start me at $29, and in 6 months i would hopefully be a GM and they wanted to potentially give me the new location with a $20,000 relocation bonus. uh yeah… i’ll take that! 

i came back and did an additional 30 minute interview. she asked me all the exact same questions as before, and asked to attend another panel interview the next day, where i was talked to by 3 more executives in the company. 
they spent 45 minutes asking me the same questions. all of them had almost nothing to do with me, and only about the operations and inner workings of the lead competing company i was previously at. they said they’d get back to me. a day later i get a phone call from the second interviewer, saying i was on speaker and it would be a short conversation. i was again asked the same questions: how they did staffing, how they opened new locations, how the ranks worked, how they trained, their grooming policies, how they discipline, how they calculate labor etc. 

i was then asked to go to an OJP. i was told i’d be paid the wage of the position i was applying for ($29) and when showed up, got added to payroll, and saw that i was only getting paid one dollar BELOW their base level pay, at $21. in my area they hire at $22. 
 whatever. i’m already here. i drove 2 hours to be here. i worked a 6 hour long shift where i was given no guidance, it was extremely slow. maybe one customer every 10-15 minutes. i was surrounded by other people all trying to look busy. i was approached and talked to by many different executives, and quite frankly out performed everyone there. they were almost all you ger than me, (i’m 26 years old) and their only experience was working a couple years at panda as a cook or shift lead. 
after cleaning/making customer connections and learning how to make the foods for 5 hours, i was called over for my interview. this is a panel of 8 executives. 4 of which i’ve already interviewed with, 2 of them have been at every interview so far. 
i was asked. the. same. freaking. questions. they spent 25 minutes asking me the same question about grooming standards over and over again. they kept saying i wasn’t answering it fully??  i genuinely think they were trying to wear me down. it felt like mind games ! 

they said “why did you leave your last company?” i answered articulately and honestly giving numerous reasons ranging from HR complaints, to hours, to work life balance, to not being challenged, i got the job when i was 16 and when i turned 25, i realized i had only
ever done one thing. and i wanted to branch out. (i think this pissed them off cause everyone at the table was like 35 yrs old and had been working for panda since they were 16)
 i also said i didn’t like my previous company’s ban on self expression. i followed each of these reasons with how panda is different, and why i’m excited to be there instead. 
they got fixated on the idea their lead competitor has “higher standards” that’s what they took from it. 

they asked me 3 times how pandas standards of grooming are not as high as my previous employers. i finally got fed up and pointed at every single executive and listed all the different things they had in their appearance that would ban them from a position at my previous company. (tattoos, colored eyelashes, piercings, bright face makeup.) i said , none of you at this table, regardless of your experience or knowledge, would make it past a second interview for an entry level position at my previous employer because of the way you look. does that answer your question? 

they kind of just sat in stunned silence and one guy finally said , “i guess we are just wondering how you’re going to react when we ask you to take out your nose piercing.” 
my jaw hit the floor. i said ….. but… you allow nose piercings…. THEY DIDNT EVEN KNOW THEIR OWN POLICIES?????
they kind of laughed it off, said “oh really? we just changed that haha.” 
and i took the opputuinity to say “we have spent a LOT of time on grooming policies… is there anything about my leadership style or my goals with the company you’d like to ask?”
they asked me what do you think the hardest part of this job will be for you?
i said, “ well honestly i think learning all the different recipes will be challenging at first, but i’m a big panda fan and i’m already familiar, i just think it will take me a little time. but i’m confident!”
they asked me how i think my trainer did that day, i felt bad cause she was at the table and she honestly hadn’t trained me on anything all day.
 i said i think she did a great job at making me feel comfortable. they then asked me how i thought they could do better and since i obviously have soooo many things i saw wrong from first jump, i just said “i saw a lot of areas in cleanliness that could improve?” and everyone just shifted in their seats uncomfortably and they kind of ended the interview. i left feeling drained, unappreciated, disrespected and used for information on the competition. it felt like a huge waste of time. 
they said they would have an answer for me on monday. 
monday rolls around and i’m texted asking what time i can complete my final interview. at this point, i was positive i didn’t want this job because this company is a mess. did i mention in this process they took and lost 3 hard copies of my resume all while holding a digital copy? 
every question they asked me that was actually about myself was answered in my resume. they did not contact a single reference (and i got some pretty big names on there) and barely even looked at it during any of my interviews. 
okay so on monday i got on a zoom interview with some random guy i’d never seen. he asked me IM NOT JOKING the same 15 questions everyone else did. at this point i’ve hit “fuck it” and i say the following:
who are you? what level are you in the company? (he’s just a random GM) 
is this how your company normally conducts interview processes because it quite frankly seems very disorganized, none of my references have been reached out to, and you’ve all asked me the exact same questions repeatedly. plus i was recruited for this position, i never actually applied in the first place. 
he just starts gaslighting me!!! literally says, “i know it may SEEM like we’re asking you the same questions, but we all gain new perspective depending on who is listening. and to be transparent if you are offered the position you’re interviewing for there will be 2 more interviews after this one.” 
i said well that’s good it shows you really take this position seriously. 😂😂
the next day i get a call from the original woman i interviewed with, and she starts the call saying “hello, i just wanted to apologize for the extensive interview process, we just want to make sure everyone has met you before we make a decision. but i’m calling you to offer you the position of shift lead” 
SHIFT LEAD? the position i originally asked for???? and you asked me to go higher. wasted a total of 13 hours worth of interviews, travelled a total of 300 miles, and you want to give me shift lead. the audacity. 
just for shits and giggles i said “what was it about my performance that made you guys decide i wasn’t manager material?” and she says “well we want someone who already knows how to cook the food.(remember the only thing i said might be a challenge for me?) and someone who knows how to humbly come in to learn, rather than think they already know how to do everything.” 
D: 
oh my god. i have managed and been in charge of opening new locations and building business for your lead competitor for over 8 years, and you spent the entirety of every interview asking me how i did it so successfully, and now you’re telling me i didn’t get the position because i’m not humble enough. i laughed at her on the phone and told her thanks but no thanks. biggest bullet dodged ever. 
i don’t know what i want from this post. i just hate this job market where everyone tries to beat you down and build you back up for FAST. FOOD. like get over yourselves. i can obviously do the job. UGH !!! i also learned the name of every kid on that kitchen, told them things i learned about their crew, asked these 17 year old kids how to make rice and we all did it laughing and smiling and made great impressions. i really feel like i was just used for insider information :( "

This made me curious about what Pat Sajak made. This didn’t seem as concrete, but it looks like it was around $14 million. 

I’m sure the entertainment industry is quite different from the corporate bs I deal with, but I couldn’t help drawing comparisons. Loyalty doesn’t mean shit. Keep the same job for ages means minimal pay increases. Hire externally? Pay much more. 

I have nothing against Ryan Seacrest as a host. I just don’t think he adds double the value that Pat did.

These are the things that have been done by said toxic coworker

•	⁠being condescending to me in front of other coworkers
•	⁠constantly trying to undermine me and my work in front of my team
•	⁠making sexist and homophobic “jokes”
•	⁠if I bring up an issue, say I ask him to please not say something because it makes me uncomfortable, in a couple of weeks, he will do it again, then be like “oh, sorry I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable”
•	⁠overloads me with tasks with zero guidance after my boss has told him not to do that since I don’t report to him, and then will make public comments when something isn’t done fast enough or correctly
•	⁠is always trying to make me look bad to my boss who tells me to ignore it because the work speaks for itself
•	⁠makes sly comments any opportunity he gets. An example, I was away because I needed surgery and when I returned to work he made a huge deal that I was able to work from home when I was recovering when my boss doesn’t usually let anyone work from home and this caused issues with coworkers who didn’t know the situation and thought it was favouritism . This happens frequently and any time my boss and I come up with agreements, he will undermine my boss and argue with my boss, and then bring it up to my team and say that “people” take advantage of my boss, he won’t say my name, but give enough information so people know he’s talking about me

Most recently, he asked me on our public chat to do something and I was busy with back to back meetings, and when I had a chance I explained why I couldn’t reply. He told me in front of everyone that I had attitude when I didn’t. I messaged him privately and explained my side, expressed that I didn’t appreciate that he was implying that I had attitude, and explained how doing that publicly could be demoralizing and affect team morale and that I hoped that we didn’t go back to having a toxic work environment (previously we had 4 people quit because he did the same to them, since we have hired new people, the morale has been better since no new employee has experienced this yet). I then apologized if what I said came across in a negative way, but that I would appreciate if going forward he would privately clarify with me first. This was last week, since then, he has been completely ignoring me when I send an email or ask a question on teams but answering everyone else and completely isolating me and stonewalling me.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to handle a situation like this or should I just throw in the towel and take a huge pay cut and go elsewhere "

There are fumes from different chemicals all over the place that seem toxic, theres no safety labels for them or training on what some of them do, sometimes they leak, we have gas mask but not sure if the carts are correct and they're not required . No guard railing when you're on a high place. We literally dump chemicals into the sewage god knows what the fuck it is. 
Also worried since it's my first job in a long time that I'll be let go or harassed at work if this stuff doesn't go through, have a friend that recommended me and hope they don't fuck her over me reporting this.

  So I never post on this sub but I thought I’d share my experience today:

Some backstory though, two things were happening simultaneously; a point system in my work place was being implemented on July 1st, and I was out of state for my college orientation/ visiting nearby family and wouldn’t be back July 2nd.

  So when I was coming home from my vacation I suddenly got hit in the head with illness (sore throat, stuffed nose, dry cough) I didn’t have access to a thermometer on the trip home but I knew I was feeling feverish, and I knew work had scheduled me for today, so I was dreading something happening.

Something happened: when I got home my temperature was at 101. Of course I didn’t want to go to work because of this, but with the new point system in place I would be striked simply because I got home too late to schedule a doctors appointment for the day (I would be given 3 points out of 6 that would fire me)

Despite this, I told my situation to my boss in hopes she would understand what was happening. She did not. So I told her I quit and proceeded to leave the work’s group chat. Honestly it felt so freeing because I knew no matter how much I fought it I would still be marked.

TL;DR: I quit because work wanted to give me points for being sick and unable to produce a doctors note in one day’s time."

I would love to hear others opinions and thoughts. 

The hotel industry will abuse its employees like nothing else. Management is always salaried and expected to work 10 hour days - truly for what? At one point I was running a property for $36k a year. 
Hourly staff is suppose to just put up with long hours because ownership won’t make any changes to increase hourly wages to entice more staff to be hired. A lot of ownership companies think $13 an hour is fine for housekeeping. Truly insane. 

You get yelled at from the people you work for and the people you are supposed to be taking care of that are staying at the hotel. You cannot win in any sense. And don’t get me started on how people have to started to be since Covid - people are even more insane now. 

Owners do not want to put ANY money into properties that are absolutely falling apart and still expect them to get rave reviews and make budget (and if they don’t it’s your head on the chopping block.)

There are so many “leaders” in positions that shouldn’t be due to their complete incompetence which you have to make up for essentially. I have had so many people that were my leaders or leaders that I worked with, that I had to show them how to do things or how things are suppose to be done. Such as my last position - I was a sales manager for two properties and essentially they wanted me to be at the properties 7 days a week because the operations team could simply not handle anything. 

You are also on call 24/7 - you always have to be alert and your whole life has to be surrounded by the hotel. And you are always worried about job safety - this industry is not worth it at all. 

If anyone has left the industry please tell me what you do now so I can never go back. 😂"

3,2024-07-03,Am I in the wrong?,u/Style_Critical,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ducc5t/am_i_in_the_wrong/,antiwork,"I've been in HR  for close to ten years. In my current company, I've had 3 managers in a span of 1 year. I've also been here for a year and throughout all those management changes, I managed to keep our department and organization afloat. I did all the hiring alongside all the HR responsibilities except payroll. 

I do not get along well with my newest manager because in my view, I do all the grunt work while he sits there attending meetings, presenting my work (without giving me credit), and/or write workplace policies. I felt very alone and unsupported I requested to be transferred to another project. The head of HR for our country offered to transfer me to a different project but not an HR role. I initially accepted then upon contemplation, declined. Because I have worked so hard in my career to get me to this point and moving to another field will mean my HR growth will be hampered. The role is in finance. The HR leader then tells me, ""you do not handle relationships well. That's why you should be in finance."" 

I don't know what to think. I feel so numb but I haven't stopped crying. I feel as if all the efforts I put towards this place was all for nothing because the big boss does not think I'm suitable for my current job anyways. This despite all the hard work I put in after they changed my manager three times. It's just me and the manager in our department so everything fell on me every time they leave. 

I ended up accepting the offer but I am not happy nor am I confident I can do the job.  "

Today I was called into the office and was told my contract is being terminated due to my Bradford score, essentially a score of your attendance. My score was high and I didn’t understand why, every day I’ve had off I was either ill and / or was told to go home, or I had it pre-booked off. I argued against the termination and my boss said there was nothing he could do, even though there was, he was THE boss. It’s been a few hours since I left and my other coworkers felt awful, my mother has called in telling them it’s an unfair dismissal because I’ve not had any prior warnings about my attendance beforehand, which was apart of the letter they gave me.

I was off for 12 days total because of heat stroke, gastritis and a broken elbow, all separate occasions. I find it a miracle how little time I had off, this all happened since October 2023 and now it’s July 2024. They believe ‘it’s showing red flags’ which I could understand, even though it was my coworkers telling me to go home when I was ill and that SAME boss telling me I couldn’t go into work with my broken elbow.

I’ve had a rough few years and this job gave me exactly what I wanted, it gave me an open space with incredible coworkers, minimum wage for an apprenticeship (6.40 ph/ $8.13 ph for my Yankee bros), and a reason to keep going on, my boss didn’t care when I said that. 

I’m super frustrated and confused, my mother has been spam calling my boss for the past hour and a half now and he’s dodging the answer button like it has Ebola."
184,2024-07-03, Cursed out interviewer ,u/Kevin_dream88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ducgj2/cursed_out_interviewer/,antiwork,"So finding a job has been difficult. I was let go from my previous job in March and will be out of unemployment in August. I found a great job posting on Indeed that was great. I knew I was fully capable of doing the job. It was a confidential company, small business. The pay was a lot less than my previous salary, but it was still good money by a long shot.



I get ready and right at that moment this guy walks in, the owner of the company, a brother about my age. The background blurs her out, but you can tell she's working in a messy bedroom with clothes on the floor. He had emailed me at 4:30 in the morning so I know he's probably busy and I appreciate that.



He is a dick, offensive and almost argumentative with his responses to my responses. He tells me, ""You're not what I imagined for the role."" I said, “Well, I can tell we'll be working closely together and you're really busy, I noticed your email at 4:30. What was your idea for this role, what are your expectations?"" He asked me what I meant, and I said, ""You've stated that I'm not what you think I am for the role, so what do you need?""



He starts with how he can't have anyone wanting to climb a corporate ladder before he can provide that upward mobility. I said it's good that I've done corporate management and my main reason for this job is I want to get out of that rat race. He had asked me to answer some pre-interview questions the day before, so I wrote a nice email detailing my past accomplishments and goals.



One of the goals that came up was the family. I am currently taking care of my mom while she lives with me and my new husband during chemotherapy. We want a family one day but we haven't had a really hard fertility battle.



I ignored it, but he said again how he couldn't have someone go on maternity leave and leave his job to someone else to pick me up. He is a small business and has no manpower. Not wanting to pay short term disability... he just started saying a bunch of wild and inappropriate things.



So I cut him off and gave him a piece of my mind. Along the lines of, hey listen, I don't think this is going to work. Frankly, you were an idiot from the moment we started this interview. Luckily for you I can't get pregnant, but it wasn't very good anyway. you are crazy



He looked stunned and when I finished the session he started muttering ""wow"".



Damn man, I can't believe I have to spend about 40 years doing this.

8,2024-07-03,Should I just call out on my last shift?,u/Sufficient-Row-2173,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ducn8f/should_i_just_call_out_on_my_last_shift/,antiwork,"I recently put in my two week notice but I really don’t even want to go in. Just feel obligated because I was scheduled for that shift before I even put in my notice. 

I’ve never been a “bad” employee. I’d feel like a bad one if I didn’t show up but I can barely stomach the thought of going back there and what can they do anyway? They can’t fire me if I’ve already quit. I already have my paycheck from my most recent shift. 

They soft fired me by only giving me one day a week (sometimes none). I don’t even really know what I did wrong. Just one day the manager who does the schedule kind of did a “switch” and started treating me like dirt. I know he had just started in a higher position the same time I got hired and part of me just assumes the power got to his head and since I was the newest employee, he chose me to be his victim. 

We get a lot of frequent customers and they liked me. I got hella tips from them. Even when I was only working once a week they’d ask me where I’ve been. So I feel bad that I won’t even get to say goodbye to them but the day they have me working isn’t even a day where see I’d see them anyway. Which was part of my final straw. They took the one good thing away from me: my customers. 

This was just a side gig. I have a main job with benefits and I’m a supervisor there. I just wanted a side job for extra money and because I was getting bored. I’ll find another. It just sucks to not even know what I did wrong. It’s been a real blow to my ego because I’ve always done well at every job. "

With those two things in mind - simplicity and profitability - why no political will from corporations to see this through?
From my perspective this amounts to an expansion of the corporate-welfare model to the general population. Currently the corporate-welfare model seems to operate on a combination of tax incentives, subsidies and suppression of wage growth for the general population. Underemployed, unemployed and disable people are supposed to be given benefits to participate in the market (although in places like the U.S., those benefits are completely inadequate). So how do advocates of UBI propose to convince (or force, whichever) capitalists and governments into setting UBl up?"

Despite this, I wasn’t upset to be rejected from the role.

What is upsetting is to JUST receive a rejection, in a template email from HR rather than the people who interviewed me or who had communicated with me to set up the interview. I feel like it’s extremely poor form to not give any kind of feedback to someone you have interviewed - especially when that person asked if disability accommodations would be possible for the role (specifically for a hybrid role to be made fully remote as I have difficulty with travel) and you had said both during the application process and interview that you would get back to them. It’s not a great look.

This is a small industry and I don’t want to burn bridges, but I also believe in standing up for what’s right. I’ve emailed both the HR contact and one of the people I have interviewed with to request proper feedback.

How long is it reasonable to wait before leaving an interview review on Glassdoor?

Honestly in amongst all the ghosting and fake remote jobs it is hard enough job seeking while disabled, this is just frustrating."

To reiterate, f*** you, you narcissistic, mentally constipated, overpaid excuse for a human being.

You are a carbuncle on the a***hole of humanity. This sentiment fails to convey the strong depth of feelings that I wish to share. 

I hope your victories are meaningless, your eyebrows merge into a busy hedge and you spend your days walking in decreasing circles until you get dizzy. 

The universe cannot erase you as a mistake, but I hope your warranty expires soon. 

May you develop a stench so foul, durian will seem fragrant next to you. 

May each of your toes turn upwards and haunt your nose with their smell. 

May cats and dogs chase you home every day, while seagulls and pigeon bombard you with their sh*t. 

And one day, when you are old and weary, may you have a heart and realise what a royal c**t you've been.

I average around a hundred and forty hours in the 10 day working period of two weeks.  Furthermore my performance reviews are excellent and front line staffers know me as a positive and dependable person. 

 I am not from anywhere even remotely close To here and I have no ties to the area, I move differently.  I am also overqualified for my position.   The first thing that anyone notices is that nepotism and favoritism are rampant with nearly all of the managers and administrative staff being drawn from a small local group related to each other through marriage, family, or intermingled interests.  Their children and subordinate members are littered throughout the lower echelons of the organization as well.  This group has alienated and/or purged its locality to the point where the organization imports contract employees to fill nearly half of the workforce and is still woefully understaffed.  Especially considering the dangerous environment.  I am not a contract employee.

It is very difficult to last past a couple of years here due to burnout.  Also the aforementioned admin group have clearly adopted an oppositional stance towards any outsider.  Outsiders, no matter their contribution, are subjected to random disciplinary measures.  I had been targeted several times but was covered by a barely functioning union and otherwise confident that my own performance would stave off the specter of good ol boy shenanigans that plagues so many rural, isolated communities.  

I was promoted a couple of weeks ago to a position that is not covered by the union.  I was then placed on administrative leave briefly and issued an unintelligible letter of dismissal on the grounds that my personal conduct was in violation of a few vague organizational policies.  I have until Friday on leave and then it will take effect. There was no option included in the letter that granted me a rebuttal and the letter showed that it had been sent out to other state entities as well.  

Should I hastily resign?

Work zero hours on the 4th of July, get 8 hours of holiday pay.",u/SomeGalFromTexas,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1duiq8l/work_8_hours_on_the_4th_of_july_get_4_hours_of/,antiwork,"Just as it says. I work full-time as a supervisor at a grocery store. I'm paid hourly, and I am subject to the hourly pay system. Basically, if you have been with the company for 6 months or longer, you receive holiday pay for something like eight holidays a year. If you are scheduled to be off on the holiday, you receive 8 hours of pay at your regular rate. It's not considered overtime. Holiday pay is a separate thing. You also receive the holiday pay even if you work 5 days that week , and there's no loss of hours. If you are scheduled to work on the holiday, you are paid time and a half. That means that if you work 8 hours that day, you receive pay for a total of 12 hours that day, which works out to getting four extra hours of pay, not eight. Further, you do not get to double dip. If you work, you get time and a half. If you are off, you get holiday pay up to 8 hours of straight time. Basically, if you're off, you get a full extra day of pay. If you work, you get a half a day of extra pay.

Something does not add up, and it smells just about as bad as the spoiled cheese that we come across in the deli. The way I see it, and the way the rest of us who are scheduled to work on the holiday see it, we should also receive the 8 hours for the holiday in addition to the time and a half. We don't get to celebrate. We're dealing with one of our busiest days of the year, and because it's a holiday, we're already short scheduled so we are picking up the slack. Throw in a few call offs, and we're busting our butts for that 4 hours of pay. Of course our store director can't do anything about it at the store level, not really. There's no law in our states that even requires holiday pay, so it's as if we're supposed to be grateful for what scraps we do work for. We should be grateful that we're getting a few extra crumbs. If anybody does call off because they are hacked off about having to work the holiday for next to nothing extra, they lose even that little bit of extra Plus an entire day of pay. It's very frustrating, and it really is not right.

I have a bunch of sick time, so I'm thinking about taking a sick day after the holiday, probably on my birthday next week. I'm going to suggest that anybody else in the same boat who has time to use, to go ahead and use it the same week. We all get our stories together, we come up with similar symptoms, and management can just think that there's crud going around the store. And they would be right, just not the crud they're thinking of.

Any better ways to deal with this until I either leave for something better, or corporate changes its way of doing things? I think the first option will come before the second."

While others have to work 8.5 hours and only get paid 8 hours (eg 9-5:30 with an unpaid lunch break). We are all the same rank in the company, all get the same benefits (aka none), all paid hourly. Yet some of us get paid for lunch while others don't. I don't see how that's legal. 

Whether or not you lunch break is paid, it's not at all uncommon for supervisors to interrupt your break to talk to you about work tasks, or even to require you to leave your lunch to help them with something. To me, that seems illegal. If my break is unpaid, I'm legally required to be relieved of all work duties. Which I would think includes being on-call for whatever work bullshit supervisors want to yap about, and especially being forced to do work during your lunch break.

I'm wondering if I have a case against my employer for wage theft. If they're paying some people for lunch, everyone should be getting paid for lunch. And if we aren't being relieved of all work responsibilities, then lunch is not actually a break. It's not right that I have to work longer to get paid the same amount, *especially* when they interrupt our lunches. 

This has been going on for years. If they were forced to actually pay us for all that extra time it would be overtime pay since it puts us well over 40 hours a week, so it's a substantial amount of money for myself and my co-workers. 

I understand that employers aren't legally required to pay you for your lunch break. The crux here is that 1) some people are already being paid for their lunches, while others aren't, and you can't have it both ways. Either lunch is paid or unpaid. And 2) we are expected to be available to our supervisors during lunch. 

I can't find a legal advice subreddit geared toward labor laws, so if anyone knows of one please let me know!

I was just reading up on the different policies offered by different parties in Australia and one of the policies that the greens are offering is:

The Universal Wellbeing Payment will be enough to comfortably cover your basic needs. It will give you enough to put a roof over your head, to have a nutritious diet, to keep yourself warm in winter and cool in summer, and to get to and from the places you need to go.

The UWP will always be above the poverty line. Based on the cost of living as at March 2022, the Universal Wellbeing Payment will start at $615 per week for every person aged 16 and over.

[https://universalwellbeingpayment.com.au/](https://universalwellbeingpayment.com.au/)

This payment is made to you if you are working or not, the tax is only going to be taken from the richest end of town.   
  
This is the top 10 rich list for Australia:

* Gina Rinehart; US$30.2 billion.
* Andrew Forrest & Family; $21.5 billion.
* Harry Triguboff; $16.2 billion.
* Mike Cannon-Brookes; $13.7 billion.
* Scott Farquhar; $13.5 billion.
* Anthony Pratt; $10.3 billion.
* Cliff Obrecht and Melanie Perkins, $8.8 billion.
* Bianca Rinehart & Siblings, $8.5 billion.

A fun game is to divide your total wealth by theirs e.g. If you have $100,000 dollars in the bank than Gina Rinehart is 302,000 times richer than you lol."
9,2024-07-03,Started a new job and I dread it every day (hours are full time 9-5),u/Fabulous-Barbie-6153,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1duk0r4/started_a_new_job_and_i_dread_it_every_day_hours/,antiwork,"Hello, this is my first post in this subreddit, gonna try to make it as short as i can, i apologize in advance if it’s a little lengthy :)

I recently started a new job outside of my field. It seemed okay at first, but now i’m starting to have some second thoughts. I graduated in graphic design, but the industry is extremely saturated at the moment, hence why I am not working in it right now. I just have a standard administrative assistant office job for the time being. I’ve only been here for about a month now, so maybe I’m judging the role too soon, but I just feel so incompetent and clueless at times. Particularly what I hate most is answering the phones—I’m the only one on phones and I have social anxiety, so I really struggle with it. The phones are mostly dead 80% of the time, but there’s always that fear of when someone does call—especially because I feel like I don’t know how to answer many questions that people call to ask. 

I want to go back to graphic design, but there’s issues with that, too. First, the job I had before this one was graphic design and I actually didn’t mind it too much, I really only left because it became a toxic work environment quickly and my boss had unrealistic expectations all the time. The problem w the design field right now is 1. it’s oversaturated, and 2. designers are expected to wear many, many hats. I would say I’m good at design, but I’m not an expert at everything—I can’t animate, I can’t code, I’m not great at web design—honestly, my strengths are in branding/logos, print design, advertisements, and social media design. Not sure if this makes me sound lazy or like i’m just not ‘willing to learn,’ but I don’t want to become a master at animation and web design—I just want to be good at what i’m good at and hope that it’s enough. Graphic designers shouldn’t be expected to know every specialty anyways, that’s why there are creative teams (which hardly exist anymore in today’s market, lol). 

Anyways, to wrap things up, I just can’t seem to shake this existential dread I feel about having to go to this office job every day. I also just came back from a week vacation and honestly I have felt worse about working since then. I wake up some mornings feeling slightly nauseous and anxious because I have to rush to my job in the morning. I can’t see how I can keep doing this every day, I literally look forward to every day I don’t have to work. I hate to be that person who lives for the weekends only, but that’s who Ive seem to become. I also only feel like i’ve become myself again after 5:00. Honestly, my job isn’t even all that terrible.. it’s just extremely boring for someone like me with anxiety and ADHD.

So, what do i do? Do i try to go back into design even with the issues that are present in that field? I haven’t even had the time to update my design portfolio since I’m already exhausted after work most days..

I just can’t deal with the dread I feel about working every day anymore. I’ve already given up on the idea of dream jobs existing, I just want a job that I don’t hate :/"

A buddy of mine is getting married this weekend. He’s had a really rough life, but he found a good woman and we’re all super happy for him.

Anyways, he’s a middle manager at his company and had his leave approved for this week and next weekend since February, six months ahead. 

Yesterday, he was informed that due to another middle manager getting injured off duty, he will need to come in this weekend and at least half of next week (his scheduled honeymoon). 

Obviously, he pushed back on his boss and explained (though he shouldn’t need to) that this is his wedding day and honeymoon, the leave was approved half a year ago, there are people from all over the country who cleared their schedules to be here, and thousands of dollars were invested in this. He was simply told that he’s a manager, so he needs to set the example and show he is serious about his obligations to the company. His manager cryptically threatened to fire him if he didn’t work on his wedding day and honeymoon. 

He lives and works in North Carolina. Is this legal? Does anybody have experience or someone to contact to fix this? He really needs this job, so responses that say, “Just quit,” won’t be helpful. In the immediate, looking for any sort of help. Thanks, everyone. "

Just want to share/vent about my current job. Unfortunately I’m sure some of you relate. This will be long, but I’ll put a tldr at the end!

In December I was laid off from my job of nearly 2 years. It was my first “big girl” job after college. I didn’t enjoy it so it was kinda a blessing in disguise, but also sucked because the reason I was laid off is because they’re outsourcing the jobs overseas. They gave me severance though, so thankfully I was able to not stress too much while finding a job. I was unemployed for 2 months, until February of this year, until I found my current job.

Now I work at a small law firm. It’s just me and 3 other people: me (F24), my boss/lawyer (M68), a contractor lawyer (M67), and a paralegal (M60). I function as a receptionist and paralegal, so I answer the phones and manage the office as well as drafting legal documents and other paralegal duties. The M60 paralegal and I work 8:30-5:30 M-F, completely in office. The 2 lawyers make their own hours and can work from home whenever.

I’ve never worked in law, with people who are much older with me, or in a completely in-office work environment, so I didn’t really know what to expect. But I went in with an open mind. My first day the paralegal tells me as soon as he has the chance about our boss and his “quirks”. Tells me everything I should look out for, how I should act around him, what i should and shouldn’t do, his triggers, etc. He’s been working for him for 20+ years and has seen him do some insane stuff. Obviously at that moment my heart sank into my stomach. Thankfully though, between family, friends, media, etc., I’m pretty good at reading people and handling difficult people. So I kept all of that in mind but tried not to get too anxious over it.

Well, nearly 5 months in and boy, the paralegal wasn’t kidding. This man is unlike anyone I’ve ever met in my life. Completely 100% unique, and in a very bad way. He has most of the characteristics of your stereotypical, older generation business owner, plus his own mental issues that have never seemed to be addressed.

For starters, he acts like a child and is unreasonable almost 100% of the time. If a client requests something or wants a correction to something he did, he takes complete offense to it and will freak out. His and the paralegal’s offices are on the other side of the office, and I constantly hear him yelling and screaming to the paralegal and to himself about anything and everything. He’ll be completely fine and just chilling, and 2 seconds later he’ll be in crazy freak out mode. He overthinks everything, and a simple request, question, etc. will send him into a frenzy. It makes the days when he’s working in-office stressful, with me constantly having to look over my shoulder even though I always do my job and am doing nothing wrong. He is always quick to find something wrong but never ever quick to praise. I’ve been late a handful of times since I’ve started, the most being 15 minutes when I was stuck on the interstate behind an accident. Otherwise the other couple times I’ve been late it was 1-5 minutes. That is literally my only flaw when it comes to this job. And everytime I’m late he has a bad attitude with me for the rest of the day and talks shit about me to the paralegal.

I get 10 days of PTO a year. This includes vacation, sick, and personal time, which is insane to me. But here’s the kicker. If you ask him about taking time off, it becomes an enormous ordeal. I let him know right after I started the job in February that sometime soon I would be moving. Not sure when yet, but I’d let him know as soon as I knew and if I needed to take a day off for it. He said okay thank you for giving me a heads up. Fast forward to the end of April, I sign a lease and the next day tell him about it and that I’ll need May 31st off of work to move. By the way, this was the first and only day I have asked him to take off for in my 5 months of being here to this day. Immediately he starts panicking and saying that he’s not sure because he might need me here (for context, we’re not a busy firm. some days I literally have nothing to do and have to scrounge around for work). To calm him down I told him that when the time comes if I need to come in the second half of the day to help I can. But I said that knowing that they wouldn’t need my help and everything would be fine. After a week of “figuring everything out” he approved me for the whole day, with some disdain in his voice. The day rolls around, I move, I come into work the next Monday and ask the paralegal how everything went. Everything went perfectly fine, as I knew it would.

Fast forward to this week. We get 5 holidays off a year. Memorial day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 2 days for Thanksgiving and Christmas if it’s not “too busy”. The 4th of July is on a Thursday this year, and we’re so so so slow right now. I build up the courage to ask him if we can have Friday off too. We’re not busy, and it’s basically going to be a dead day. Plus we’ve been working really hard and do our jobs well, and have been receiving some great compliments from clients. I ask him, and his demeanor immediately goes dark and he starts interrogating me and going off. “Where did you get that idea from?” “I’ve never done that before, and never heard of a business doing that.” etc. What he said to me and the tone he used was completely disrespectful. Talking to me like I was trash. I had even prefaced the question with “you can say totally say no and don’t feel obligated to say yes, i just figured I’d ask”. He really upset me with how he was speaking to me, so tears start flowing from my eyes. I tell him I’m sorry I even asked, it was just a question. He says he’ll “do some research” and let me know what he decides. He goes to the other side of the office and tells the paralegal to call some of our competitor firms and see what they’re doing Friday. 2 out of the 3 he called are going to be closed. He goes home to work from home the rest of the day, stews on the decision, and calls the contract lawyer to see what he thinks. The contract lawyer and I have become close and he encouraged me to ask for us to have off Friday because he thinks we deserve it. So of course he tells my boss that it’s a good idea. Right before we’re off for the day, he calls me to let me know that he is letting us have Friday off as an act of “appreciation”. I’m thankful that we have off Friday now, but I knew it’d come with a cost. He was planning on coming into the office today, but told the paralegal over the phone that he isn’t now. He feels like he’s “being taken advantage of” and he doesn’t want to come in so he doesn’t “get ugly” with us.

There’s more, but this post is already long. Yes, of course, I’ve been applying to other jobs. Thankfully the contract lawyer said I could use him as a reference. The job itself is great and it’s nice working in a small, quiet office, but it’s not worth being talked down to. If you’ve read this far, thanks for reading. And if you’re in a similar situation to me, please don’t let your boss walk all over you. They have no right to treat you like their property and like trash. I sure as hell am getting out of here.

TLDR:
- Work at a small law firm (me F24, boss/lawyer M68, contract lawyer M67, paralegal M60)
- Boss is volatile, yells and screams about things that don’t matter, quick to scold and very slow to praise, etc
- Gets mad about using PTO
- I asked nicely if we could have this Friday off (day after 4th of july, which is one of the 5 holiday days off we get a year) and he freaked out and made me cry. Gave us the day off but is bitter about it and feels he’s being “taken advantage of”"

Within the first two weeks I got injured at work on my foot by a manager. I pretty much lost fucking everything. My life, my house, and I couldn’t walk for a week so I had to leave. People are saying that I should get a workers comp lawyer but I just want to work. So this manager tells me I needed to go to a doctor and that they would pay for any bills that came. So I went go X-rays and a week later got cleared. Since I stand up on my feet all day I can’t go into light duty. Then I have to pass this food and beverage test. I tried studying it for so long but due to me having anxiety and adhd I have a tough time remembering things unless I do them over and over again (cocktails). Now they tell me I can’t work until I pass said test and if I don’t pass it I’ll be let go. She told me “I don’t allow people to take the test twice.” This is the follow up email that I want to send. Please let me know if it’s okay.

I tested and I think I did fairly well after getting injured at work, losing my housing and moving not knowing if I was going to be on the street or having my next meal. I studied as much as possible while I was on leave recovering. I only eat once a day when I work or once a day out of work because I still need money to get to work. I asked if I could use the notes made on the test so I could pass to know exactly what to study for and was told no. If I could use the notes took in contrast to what I did get right I could have passed the test today. There was few things I needed to know to pass the test but not being able to either get the notes or have a pre test log on what to study for is hard, and this is with my disabilities, anxiety and adhd. I can make the cocktails, I just needed to practice more of them which is why I’ve been training on service as much as possible. I missed some because I didnt make them or just forgot because of the extreme pressure I get not only taking tests but just on my day to day life. Furthermore, when we were doing the review of the test we had to go and look up the cocktails, what specific alcohol they used in the cocktails but we haven’t had some of tequilas or alcohol to make them. We don’t have the proper tools. I haven’t seen a stirring glass or a Yari since I’ve been there. The old fashion takes smoked chips which I haven’t seen anyone use. I couldn’t find the chips to smoke the old fashioned or a torch, wood plate and jar to keep the smoke within the cocktail to make it like it’s on paper but I’m supposed to know that

93,2024-07-03,Called the ethics hotline.. fired the next day.,u/thegrizz24,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dupvbb/called_the_ethics_hotline_fired_the_next_day/,antiwork,"On 6/23 I fractured two ribs outside of work. I went to the ER, they did a CT scan and so forth and suggested I take at least a week off and see my regular doctor before returning to work. I took the doctors note to work and tried talking to my boss about my options because I wasn't sure how long I would be out. I radioed him and he said he was too busy to talk and to leave the note on his desk. I asked the receptionist what I had to do to apply for short term disability, so I called Sedgwick and got that rolling. 

On 6/27 I seen my regular doctor to get his opinion on when I should return to work. I was still pretty sore, coughing, sneezing, turning my body, lifting my arm, and even walking exacerbated the pain. I operate a payloader, so it's not as physical as most production jobs, but it could still cause pain or slow down recovery time. He suggested I take a few more days off and then I could go back to work on 7/4 on light duty. I then took this new doctors note to work, this time my boss was at his desk, talking with my supervisor. I showed him the note and explained I could come back to work on 7/4 on light duty. This is when he suggested I come back on 7/1 on light duty because the difference was only 3 days. I'll admit this is when I started to lose my composure, I was in pain, and as far as I'm concerned I was a hard worker, and perhaps valuable to the company. I said I wasn't going to go against my doctors orders, and that is when he said, well I don't really care its your PTO anyways. As far as I knew if I was out for longer than 7 days I qualified for short term disability. My boss was using my PTO as sick leave, assuming I would be back to work on 7/1. I explained to him that I opened a case for STD, and I cannot use PTO and STD as I would have to pay the PTO back, I also mentioned something about FMLA but I wasn't sure how it worked, if it needed to be done retroactively or not. Again, I now had an attitude because I felt like I was being disrespected. I told him that he needed to stop using my PTO because I qualified for a leave of absence. He didn't like that I was telling him what to do, and I called him out on his manipulation, as he was trying to get me to disregard my doctors opinion. He said I would regret talking to him like this, I said I was done talking for now, and I would be able to work on 7/4. He said we would need to talk before I could come back to work. 

Mind you my supervisor was there the whole time, silent. I thought I had a decent relationship with my supervisor, we had went golfing a couple times, I met his wife and kid, his mother was sick for a while and I would follow up with him about her condition. 

Later that day I called Sedgwick to update them on my doctors orders, and reluctantly called HR to confirm that I qualified for a leave of absence, which they confirmed. I also called the ethics hotline and explained what happened because I felt it was out of line for him to suggest that I come back earlier than what the doctor suggested, and he refused to talk to me on 6/24 when I brought the doctors note in. I didn't do it anonymously, I put my name on it because it would be no secret who I was once he heard the story from HR or whoever handles the ethics complaints. 

On 6/28 my PM and supervisor called and told me I was terminated for misconduct. I'll admit I had verbal warnings in the past from my PM about misconduct because he likes to talk down to people and I don't take kindly to that. I requested the full termination letter from HR and it is full of inaccuracies. I was not yelling, I was talking firmly and with authority. I'm a 5'10 320, I have a deep overpowering voice and a beard, I can be intimidating, but I wasn't yelling at him. I was upset and in pain for sure, but I wasn't yelling. He went on to say that my supervisor and I were discussing what I could do on light duty, and if it was worth coming back to work for 1 day out of two weeks. That never happened. Again, he suggested I come back to work 3 days early on light duty. The following is an excerpt from my termination letter:

""PM responded to OP telling him could definitely request FMLA time for a personal medical injury as an alternate to conserve PTO time.  PM further stated, “ time cards are not approved for week of 6/24 until the following Monday 7/1 so we have time to figure out what path is taken and everything is simply sitting idle.”  At this point OP started yelling (talking loudly) at both Supervisor and PM""

I was the one that said I was looking into FMLA, so thats a lie. I had confirmed with HR that I qualified for a leave of absence because I was ordered to be off work for longer than 7 days. Why would I start yelling if he was going to help me figure out my options and ""everything is simply sitting idle?"" 

I requested a consultation with a labor lawyer, I work in Michigan, and it's a non-union shop. I talked to someone from the lawyers officer earlier about my situation, but I didn't ask him if I should continue the conversation with HR about the ethics report. Should I talk to them to explain my side of the story? I don't think I should because it well just be he said he said, and the PM of the plant has been with them for 5+ years. 

I'm pretty disappointed in my supervisor because I thought I had decent rapport with him, but I understand why he was reluctant to say anything, and I imagine he was sitting there when the PM concocted the b.s. termination letter. Every other place I've worked I stated quite plainly up front that I'm not here for friends, but this time was different. He is genuinely a good person, or so I believed, he is just afraid to speak his mind toward the PM. 

TLDR: Got hurt outside of work, was told by my doctor to take some time off and then come back on light duty, PM tried to manipulate me into coming back earlier than what my doctor suggested, but changed the narrative to him being accommodating about Short term disability in the termination letter. I called the ethics line on him about his manipulation, got fired the next day for misconduct. I got a consultation from a labor lawyer. Should I still talk to the person handling the ethics complaint? Michigan, Non-union shop. "

My manager is extremely unsupportive and has nothing to do with anything.  She knows how to do nothing, works from her home, but in my time there, has only contacted me to try and get me to rat on my coworkers. Anything I say ends up getting my coworker in trouble 

My coworker is extremely controlling of me due to this. She keeps telling me not to say anything to my manager about my position, never say I don't know how to do something or it will get her fired. I am so bored, I do absolutely nothing in my job description and just wait for my coworker to give me little tasks. I feel like a child. She treats me like a baby, she's nosy, and she wants to do everything together. I am going insane. I have no space, I'm not allowed to have a bad or off day without ""making her feel bad"" and I've heard so much whispering and talking about me but not a thing has been said to ME. I have no idea what I should be doing, how I should be spending my time, and what my purpose is. I feel like vomiting all day.

0,2024-07-03,Niche job and retaliation question(s),u/Scruff-The-Custodian,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dus4du/niche_job_and_retaliation_questions/,antiwork,"TL;DR AT BOTTOM 

So to start this off im going to state up top. I make 25$ an hour and work in a niche welding environment. However welding is not my only responsibility. I also do shipping and receiving (whenever our main person requires time off due to health and or vacation) and as of late i have been training to take over simple laser engraving because our new coworker/team lead in that department (who is not getting a team leads pay they told me that and they are pissed.)  is the only one doing it. 
 
I have worked at this current place for five years now and im still bottom of the ladder in terms of seniority and pay. (Not to mention i get talked to like a child despite having more blueprint reading and CAD experience than my current manager) 

 
What i do is very niche and very specialized. Ive been stuck at 25$ an hour for the last 2 years and have not recieved a Christmas bonus for the last 3 (all of our team leads and office personnel have gotten them despite not actually making tangible money for the company in terms of output or production) 
 
Since this is such a niche market. We only have one competitor in our metropolitan area. Owners and GMs of shops tend to talk amongst themselves and i know for a fact my boss talks to the other shops GM. Since i feel like im being stretched like laffytaffy from one dept to another ive been wanting to stay on the same career path but also not work at the place im currently at...... Unless i get fair compensation. However. Finding people to talk with and get a market evaluation for what i should be paid is damn near impossible. 
 
I feel like they think they can run a skeleton crew with me being at the bottom and absorbing most of the shit when it comes my way i.e:  Having me wrap up other peoples jobs in protective casing when im not the one who worked on it. Filling out other coworkers paper work and printing it because they cant use the system we have in place and ignorance is their best excuse. Im also the only one who actually gets "" Managed "" due to my boss working with his highschool best friend and the others being either previous managers or on afternoon shift and not within his purview for 7 out of 8 hours.  I am also the one who tries to cover my ass the most and gets blame thrown on me when weldments come back
 
I have come to think because im relatively young (27) and my manager is 38 and ive been the only laser welder in the last 6 years to make it this long. I dont want to be percieved as a sucker. Yet they dont want to compensate me fairly. 


Herein lies the question. How do I : 
 
 
A) go about finding out how much i should be compensated for the extra workload i am currently taking on and in future will probably take more on.
 
 
B) if i do apply to a competition job and the manager finds out and takes retaliatory actions against me, what do i do then? Im already bottom of the barrel so they could use ""punishment"" as a guise to say my responsibility is being expanded to lets say.... Custodiary duties or cleaning out the lathe metal shard catch( im allergic to the grease and they know that) 
 
 C) is it in bad form to get a better offer and bring it to the table where i am currently at and potentially burn a bridge. 

 
The only reason i would not want to start at a new place is because now i have 15 days off (not paid)  and full dental, vision, drug, and various coverages.

 
I just want to be treated like a fucking human being more than anything. My boss however still wants to talk to me like a toddler even though i can run 3 departments. What do i do. Please help. 


TL;DR. Only making 25$ an hour. Taking on multiple responsibilities. More than other coworkers. Been at the job 5 years. Still bottom of pay and seniority. Despite all responsibility get talked to like child. Only one other shop in the area does what we do and theres a 85-95% chance my GM and competition GM talk. I dont want to burn either bridge but i want fair compensation. What do i do? "

I have been too kind with my project owner and my coworkers. Accepting tasks from left to right and trying my best to learn how to use our product at the same time.

And then, a few weeks ago, I had my yearly 1-1 evaluation with my boss and he thinks that I'm not worth an extra 2% raise because I don't talk enough during meetings and I don't interact enough with each of my coworkers outside of meetings. Long story short, our meeting went like this:

>""It will be a hard discussion today but, I feel like you are fairly compensated if we compare your salary to your coworkers. I can't give you a raise this time because I think you didn't grow enough in the past year, and I feel like you don't interact enough with your coworkers during and outside meetings. I told you multiple times to talk more during meetings and ask more questions to each of your coworkers and try to put yourself on the spot.""

Since I'm working here, my coworkers went through 2 raises, I got denied both of them. The first time was because I got hired 2 months prior, I was too new. 

I always completed all my tasks on time and with quality, always ready to help anyone in my team who need help, and this is how my boss thanks me. I feel sad and very unmotivated.

27,2024-07-03,How the corporate game is against you. True stories from someone who works a corporate job.,u/korovasynthemesc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1duxh3k/how_the_corporate_game_is_against_you_true/,antiwork,"First time posting, long post ahead. Just here to vent because I am really at the end of my rope with all the bullshit. Please read on at your discretion. 

I work a corporate job, in one of the biggest firms in the world in a highly competitive city. This job is not my first job but my first big corporate job and I'm 2 years in. For those who may not know, you need 2 things if you want to climb the ladder at my firm, 1. good performance reviews, and 2. good utilization rate. 

Performance reviews are straightforward, do your work well, be a nice person, show good teamwork and leadership skills, and your peers and seniors will give you good feedback. These feedbacks are qualitative, but ultimately turned into a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being best. Utilisation rate means how much of your time is spent doing ""billable work"" - work that clients have paid you to do. ""Non-billable work"" includes things like doing research for and writing proposals to win a client. Doing 8 hours of billable work a day means a 100% utilization rate that day, and this is calculated across the whole year. The firm sets a target for you to achieve every year. Your utilization rate target is lower the more senior you are, because you're supposed to be doing less 'actual work' when you are senior, rather you are meant to spend your time winning clients. In turn, senior leaders have a revenue target to hit. 

With that said, here's my experience two years in. 

First year, I worked hard and given my prior experience, I was told (but understandably not guaranteed) that I would be up for promotion by the end of the year. I hit and exceeded my utilisation targets. My performance reviews were great, quantifying to a ""2"", meaning I am a high performer and perform above my pay grade. (FYI not many people are ""1's"", these are given usually to the genius or rich daddy's kid). I had no enemies, was well-liked and always presentable. So, I was fully confident a promotion would be coming, or at least I would be a strong contender. Here comes the first instance of my experience of seeing corporate milking you dry and draining your soul just to save money for another year. A couple of months before the end-of-year review where your team leader (partner and director level) represents you and makes a case for your promotion to a panel, my team partner and director relocated. They relocated to another country, but still within the same firm. I was told they can no longer represent me at the EoY review. I asked why they couldn't just remotely dial in, or write a letter, to support my case, but the answer I got was just a no. I had no representation at the review because of an arbitrary rule set by corporate. Many of my peers and other seniors were shocked too. At least I would have a nice fat bonus to reward my good performance ratings, but nope... the firm ""anticipates a tough economy next year"" so my bonus was cut. I also know I am already at the top of my pay scale, I could not be paid any more unless they promoted me. So... while disappointed, I stayed, thinking what's one year more in a career of many decades climbing the ladder, right? 

Second year, once again glowing performance reviews, a ""2"" again. But after a year of the firm telling us they were hiring for a new director and partner for my team, no names, no face, no information was ever given to us. 1 full year later and my team still had no leader. What that means is there is no one going out there pitching and winning clients, so in turn no revenue and no utilisation for me and my teammates. So in the second year, I did not hit my utilization targets. I have to mention that the target for the second year was raised despite everyone knowing there would be an economic downturn, it was as if they set an impossible target to begin with. And, hear this... the leaders lowered their own revenue targets to ensure they would hit it and get their bonus, while the junior body of staff depended on revenue the senior leaders generated, which directly translates to how many hours of billable hours of work (and hence utilization) they could get. 



So, I expected nothing at the year-end review again. No one to represent me, I did not hit my targets anyway but is it my fault if we have no one to go out and win clients? I was down and defeated, the only thing that kept me above water was my positive performance reviews, knowing people who worked with me were impressed by my work. Recently, I was given some 'insider news' that the firm has decided that anyone who did not hit their targets would have their performance rating downgraded. They will just disregard the 2 that I got and put me down to a 3 (normal performer) or a 4 (underperformed). And it was this news that hit hard for me.

  
I should also mention that because the economy has been so bad, layoffs have been happening all across my industry. My firm took the 'we are not laying people off', and 'we are a family' approach. They wanted to appear better, more caring and empathetic compared to other firms in my industry. While that sounds nice, I didn't care for it. I didn't work hard in a competitive corporate job because I love it, I did it because I wanted to climb the ladder and find what society considers ""success"". I was ready for the hard workers and good performers to be rewarded while the slackers and bad performers were laid off. Why even bother doing ratings and reviews if it was going to be ignored in the good times when rewards were meant to be given out and bad times when harsh penalties were meant to be given? I started as someone willing to climb that ladder, ready to be in this cut-throat environment, but I believe that even if it was going to be tough, it would at least be logical, but no. Corporate life is just here to fuck you over any way they can so the top can keep their wallets fat, and milk you dry of all our patience and willingness to work hard.

I told her that with the offshore project that I fear that I won't have a job after this and I'd rather have a job then be let go. She said she had ""plans"" for me.

She then repeated the connection part multiple times. I'm just like 🤷‍♀️ ok... on this call. What do I even say to that? I don't owe her anything. Sorry I messed up your plans to train everyone in the Philippines so that you can rif another 25% of the company in Q4 to save American money and have more cash flow. 

I wasn't sure what their reaction would be. My old Director who left last year (who I'm now going to be working for now lol) said that she said something similar to her when she resigned.

Next week when my current Director gets back from vacation I'm just waiting for him to become emotionally unhinged. If that's the case I'm going to just resign effective immediately."

There should never be an economy that forces an EMPLOYED person to be homeless and literally not be able to live.

1,2024-07-04,Tips for Surviving a Work Situation Making Me Feel Suicidal,u/ForsakenMail2075,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1duzaal/tips_for_surviving_a_work_situation_making_me/,antiwork,"I'll start by saying Im aware suicide isnt the answer, but I feel hopeless. Im the primary breadwinner for me own family (spouse), helping to supplement my parents (Dad is battling cancer), and our nieces (sister died a few years ago and left behind two wonderful girls). 

But here's the thing...I can't handle it. Mu family barely speaks to me, our nieces certainly could not care less beyond financial stuff, and my oldest friends in the world when I tried to outreach them told me they were busy. I get constantly piled on at work, and am in a senior leadership position (second in command of the organization I work for), but because it is public service we are not paid a ton and I am still paycheck to paycheck, saving a small amount each month (very small). I can't afford to quit outright, is why I provide this context.

This started when we got a new Director. He let everyone speak ""openly"", which equated to people being aggressive towards one another. I had previously been the interim director (I had zero interest of being the permanent one) and had to take a firm stance on the word ""no"" to my coworkers. Soon as we got a permanent one in though? They immediately began trying to micromanage me. Things that they arent even involved in and making demands to be (like finance and wanting to know everyons salary which we cannot share for obvious reasons). My boss, however, allowed this. 

People got bold. They continued to see what the new boss would allow them to get away with. Soon we were in a leadership huddle where team members started suggesting a Hispanic coworker was not doing her job (she is and is amazing at it) but because they dont know every detail, they claimed she wasnt operating to her proper capacity.

I intervened. My boss did not.

More joined in, saying how her supervisor was lazy and should not be a supervisor. Her supervisor is also hispanic. They started in on how someone else should be the supervisor (naming a meeting attendee wwho agreed!) and I intervened that this was an inappropriate discussion. 

My boss did nothing.

I took a lot of nasty comments and passive aggressive stuff for it, but I reported the incident to HR, who 100% backed me and said how inappropriate the incident was. 

My boss basically got forced into discussing the behaviors with them. 

They then got furious and called him crying saying I had upset them. My crime? Asking if we could meet regarding assignments they were askinf my direct report to do. My direct report was super busy and came to me asking, ""Hey did they ask you to assign me
these?"" They did not so I wanted to get an idea of what was entailed because as the supervisor of my direct report I need to be apprised. I thought this was logical. 

Apparently being told hey no can we discuss first? My team member is already at capacity right now, is undermining to them and nasty, and they ""cried"" to my boss literally. 

He ""talked"" to me about how wrong it was to upset them and I pushed back firmly, but was wrecked. 

Stuff got worse from there, and not just me but for others as well. Every day is a new unnecessary drama and exclusion from things. If they mess up a project (they do...frequently...) then I have to clean it up and deal with regulatory requirements. Im not their boss anymore (small organization) so my boss should intervene but does not. He just chalks it up to poor communication styles.

Every day is something new and toxic. Every. Songle. Day. I can't sleep. I can't think. My productivity is suffering. I get told my reports are too long and I should do less work, but if I shorten things it isnt enough! I get ostracized and nasty comments about my weight (Im fairly athletic and thinner) but only out if earshot of others at random. The good coworkers are all quitting or calling me upset at their treatment from people . It's a cluster mess. Then the same people beg for help (the bad ones) after messing up projects I was excluded from. I am forced to fix it all, because my boss makes me, so leaving them to flounder by refusing isn't an option. I also can't participate because i would ""kill the synergy"" these toxic people have together on their projects. It's so hurtful and frustrating and HR is like ""hey we cant help, your boss needs to."" 

So crying in the shower. Crying on breaks. Crying at night. This is not me. I used to be so happy. Random coworkers have been checking on me because they noticed something is wrong. I faked being okay. But my close family and friends could give two shits. Told my husband and friends I was feeling like I could disappear and no one would care. Not something Ive ever said before...they all went 2 hours North and left me so they could hike all day.

So message received. Im worthless to people minus bringing in money and being a workhorse. I dont know how to hang on until I can get a new job. That would help majorly, but it is hard to find jobs at the same pay. Ive applied to at least 50 and nothing...the organization I work for is in a hiring freeze. 

Has anyone else been through something luthis? How did they manage? Any tips on how to hang on until I can escape? Im trying but ironically Im living in fear of losing my job because of some popularity contest and retaliation for doing my job when I was interim director (things I said no to that coworkers wanted to do were actually illegal and against state and federal regs so I wasn't just being a jerk saying no), while desperately needing this job to care for people I love. Though not sure how much they love me...tried to tell my parents I was feeling suicidal and got screamed at and hung up on. I was even calm about it. Didnt call them crying or anything, just said Im really not doing well and feeling suicidal and like I dont matter, can we talk?

Any tips would be appreciated because Im not sure how much longer I can handle this...thank you for providing a safe forum to discuss."

I have time for a healthy breakfast and lunch. I'm enjoying cooking so always take time to prepare something healthy and nice for dinner. I exercise throughout the day and by about 7/8 I'm chilling in the sofa.

Right now, I've just decided to go to out and get some breakfast in my shorts and flip flops.

I have to go back to work soon and it's gonna suck massively.

That’s where my problem is;
We have a loooooot of chores. Clean the store, count the cash register, clean what the employees didn’t do the last day, which can include cleaning the fitting rooms, pick up all of the hangers (there’s usually around 500 of them) and sort them all in colors, size and materials. That is all before opening which is at 10am. Then, we have to do the clothing rotation, which means to remove every clothing piece marked with a color coded tag and usually do that in around 30 minutes, even when there’s over 100 pieces to remove. We also have to fill the store multiple times a day, then do the facing of the store. 

That’s the hardest part on me, on top of having to do all of the other chores, I have to do customer service, and the facing. Facing is atroucious there; people leave clothes everywhere; on the floor, on the racks, they leave shoes misplaced in the store, there is always a ton of price tags crumbled on the floor (from people stealing), clothes in the wrong category; for example, women’s shorts with women’s long sleeves. The problem is not the task itself, it’s because we’re so little employees that the task becomes unbearable. Sometimes I have to do the whole store to myself, and the store is as big as a small goodwill or value village.

Then here comes the customer service.
We have a strict final sale policy. Customers will yell at me if I don’t do a refund, even though it’s written everywhere that we don’t do refunds. I’ve also had a customer who always talks to me like I am pregnant (which I am not?) literally every single time she comes. Then all the other customers who I have to watch all day; ones with food and drinks, I have to clean all the mess they do; broken glass, syrup, non alcoholic beer, pops… You name it.

See, if I was paid a good amount of money for that, I wouldn’t say a word. But I make just over the minimum wage where I live (around 16,10/h) Which is not enough to survive today. 

What should I do? I feel like I am overworked and underpaid.

Just 5 free days a week and a month of vaccation every year so that I can read all the books I want, train regulary and stay in shape, have enough time to cook and visit relatives do some community service and just live my life. 

With 40-50 hours a week I am left with just enough free time do maintain my current existence - and pursue my interests only very rudimentary. Basically if you work full time you either have time for just one single interest and nothing else or several interest but only rudimentary.

My manager was fuming when they have confronted me, stating I have disappointed them (they said this 5 times in their conversation with me) because I didn't text them beforehand or they claimed to try and be supportive for me.

Thing is, I have requested for a demotion but would end up doing the same workload for less pay. Transfer is impossible as majority of the other branches are too far for me to travel to or the work culture is not ideal for me. When they started a template to help coach me, my manager said it was to protect themselves.

I have even told my manager face to face a week ago I was planning to resign. Their response? It's ""up to me"" and they claim there are others willing to fill my position. Manager even expressed that the CEO still thinks negatively of me due to a mistake I made 2 years ago without supervison. So for me it's was like they're hinting that the company does not care for me. 

Past 2 days has been extremely uncomfortable and awkward when I work with the manager. They do not make eye contact with me, ignores small talks, give short response or when I am given task by them, it's is met with passive aggressiveness because I don't do it their way. I have tried to be calm and obedient as possible as they have the power to give me a bad reference, but how can I when they are acting like this? 

My manager has a habit of selecting a staff as a target if they do a mistake or defend themselves. Then they hold a massive grudge and find ways to find mistakes on that person.

Amazon's annual net income for 2023 was 30.42 billion dollars. They had 1.5 million workers in that same year.

If Bezos suddenly became mad, turned mildly socialist and decided to distribute 50% of that net income to Amazon workers, every single worker at Amazon would have made an additional U$10,000 a year (U$845 a month). Amazon would still have grown by 15.21 billion dollars."

I bring up my disability quickly in interviews because otherwise the interviewer is beating around the bush trying to figure out why I have these limitations on my schedule. I also tell them upfront what I can physically do, and what I can't, that way I don't take a job that expects more than I can provide. Basically I'm upfront during the interview with all my issues. I don't need accommodations, just a part-time schedule. At the end of my interview I'm offered the job, I sign an employment letter as required in NY as well as other forms.

My first work day was today at noon but I'm to arrive a half hour earlier to complete the new employee paperwork. So I'm there, and I'm filling out forms when I have to go down the hall to a room with two accounting employees. I recognize one of them but couldn't remember where, but she definitely recognized me and was acting really weird. I asked for both their names again and she wouldn't respond, then I asked her directly that I recognize her but can't place her. She says she was teacher at my children's daycare / private school. I remember her then, tell her my boys are 11 now, and then continue filling out my paperwork. She excuses herself immediately and I noted the whole vibe was weird. A couple minutes later she comes back with my boss and my boss says to hold off on the paperwork because she needs to talk to the chef for a minute. So i sit there, a few minutes later the boss comes back and takes me to her office where the the chef is (Three of us). He fires me then, saying they don't need part time kitchen help. I tell them I know that the accounting lady told them something and whatever she said is why they're firing me. They start looking around and saying ""Who?"" and ""What lady?"". There's only two other people in the office area who weren't in the room with us, they knew exactly who I was talking about. So I ask them what her name is because I instantly forgot it earlier, and they say they don't know her name or who I'm talking about. The chef says that I have to leave and I get up to follow him out of the office. But then I turn quick left to go back the accounting office to ask that lady her name again and the Chef took a few quick steps after me before pulling out his phone and threatening to call the cops if I don't leave immediately. I tell him ok call, then I turn around and go into the accounting office and ask the two employees their names again. She wouldn't tell me, she just said ""Mrs. K"". I turned and left, and as I'm walking away I told my boss and the chef it's not a big deal I just wanted her name. The chef threatens to call the cops again so I stop and tell him that if the cops are coming I'm not leaving, I'm gonna stay here and give them a report. I'm not gonna have the cops chasing me through town just to get a report. He said he won't call the cops if I leave and I did just that.

My ex-wife and I have a lot of problems involving our kids, but nothing illegal. That lady wouldn't know anything about me except what she learned through school. Whatever she told them about me I'm certain is a protected issue that she isn't allowed to disclose, there were a lot of family court stuff during and after the divorce. My boss and the Chef obviously lied about why they were firing me, it was glaringly obvious it's because of something she told them. If it wasn't illegal they would've just said it's because she doesn't like you. It's not like they're protecting an unemployment payoff by falsifying the reason for termination, firing me because they don't need me anymore still qualifies me for unemployment.

Almost every restaurant I get a job with here does something illegal. I just want a normal job with normal people who don't lie, cheat, and steal."

First one was the manager. He brought an AK in, started mumbling paranoid stuff about the homeless people sleeping outside overnight, then mostly unprovoked threatened to bash the assistants head in. In all fairness the assistant isn't too good in social situations and didn't realize repeating ""Calm down man, just calm down"" often has the opposite effect haha.

Then management tried sweeping it under the rug, we didn't let them, and he sent a text of him holding the AK threatening the assistant to the store manager. He's been convicted on 4 felony counts (menacing, having a gun as a felon, and 2 counts for illegal mods) and will be out in 5-10.

Next guy got mad about the store manager cutting one of his shifts (because of his own actions, which he acknowledged) and asked us for his schedule so he could come in and kill him. Over text. 

No arrest as it wasnt overt, but immediately fired and blaming everyone else but himself. 

We work at a grocery store, just get another job if it's that stressful. The job is probably less work and less pay than McDonald's, there's no reason to throw away your life for it. There are a dozen and a half jobs right by us that probably pay better.

Now one guy lost his house, custody of his son, and his freedom for nearly a decade. The other will probably be homeless and has to walk 40 minutes in the opposite directions for groceries now.

This was mostly a rant, but guys get some therapy if you need it. A lot of cities have programs for crisis or low income patients. Don't start threatening coworkers, it's not worth it."

The US has limited public transportation and bike paths. It's pathetic but it's true. So a car or access to a car via a ride share app is a must for most people. So because it's so necessary I see it as a basic expense. But even at the entry level (affordable) segment like smaller compacts it's not even affordable used. It's a joke. 

The only people I know who have nice cars have good dual income or they're subsidized by family. It's not too far from those who have nice condos and homes. Same deal. Of course if you have easier access to money or credit as a business owner for instance you can afford a safe, reliable ride.

I'm amazed this isn't getting the traction it really should. From my understanding, the majority of the company were told we didn't meet sales expectations for last year to earn any raises or bonuses. With how much else is constantly breaking down and being restricted, it at least felt genuine that the company wasn't doing well.
But now our CEO openly shared that we had the best sales in 2023 over any previous year, and that he's expecting more traffic. He blatantly lied to the employees, especially those on the book floors, about our earnings in order to raise his income at the expense of everyone else. We have stores with broken registers, broken AC, broken escalators, broken tables and have yet to see any assistance with those, the things the actual workers deal with. 
Or worse, he's shared false information with a major news source in order to make it seem like the business is in better shape than it is. My best guess to why is likely to get more people invested in the stocks.
Either way, this man who supposedly cares about his workers, has done nothing but bring difficulties and frustration with his choices. He refused to give any raises until he was called out for buying a bookstore out of bankruptcy, and then decided one dollar is enough of a raise to disperse. I quit my position today after reading this and sharing it with my fellow employees, and I hope I'm not the only one.
I fully understand how few people are in a position to be able to just quit on the spot, and I'm not in the greatest space for it myself, but with this being our ""leadership"" we're maybe months from mass layoffs and withheld wages. He's only going to become more greedy and make conditions worse.
I seriously urge any and everyone to start preparing exit strategies and prepare for the potential worst.
Leaving that environment and system in mass is the only way to make change big enough that Daunt actually feels it. This refusal to pay employees appropriately compared to the rising inflation is getting way too common, and it will wreck social standards even more than they already are."

I also grabbed him a drink from a coffee shop because again, hot day, and I love doting on clients, I genually care for the people who are under my care.   

He told his care coordinator with the local agency for disabled and elderly folks because he was so thankful for what I did. She called my employer. Suddenly it's gross misconduct and I'm fired effective immediatly. Oh but they waited until after I worked a shift with someone else instead of calling to fire me right away because they didn't want to deal with finding a replacement.  I was a good employee for them. I worked hard, scored perfect on my performance reviews, ect.   

  
FML. I helped someone for free and got fired for it.  "
23,2024-07-04,Boss is excluding me from meetings and favoring one colleague ,u/Necessary-Object6702,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dvgdw2/boss_is_excluding_me_from_meetings_and_favoring/,antiwork,"So im in a project i created on my own in september. 
did this until January alone And then two others members joined.
 Let’s call them Susie and Kate. (Fake names). 

At the beginning whenever there were meetings with senior people, we were all invited to get the full feedback. My job is to analyse all data and create all graphs on BI tools. Susie is to find the reauirements for us before we make these graphs or code any data tables. Recently in the office, I heard Susie in 4 / 5 meetings presenting our project, with my boss and without me and Kate. Susie is not our boss. My boss never asked us if this is ok and he knows that we know the exclusion. 

I asked Susie twice if there was going to be a meeting about the graph tool and she said no. I saw her later… on that meeting in the office presenting MY GRAPHS. St the end she said I’m off on vacation if you have questions contact my colleague (me). Today Kate and I were finally added on email chain…. It started with “as discussed yesterday”. Proof that she lied about “not being in any meeting” 


Susie also noticed I made one mistake on one graph months ago (during a time my boyfriends dad was dying of cancer…) and I think she might have told the boss behind my back that I’m incompetent. She constantly tells me requirements for graphs and then two days before the deadline, she tells me she forgot to give me all the Data fields for the table and I have to start all over again and rush to finish stuff in 2 days instead of the 2 weeks we were allocated. 


I am so exhausted of this ans feel so unappreciated especially when I started this project. Feels whatever I say my boss favors her. How can I express this in a polite constructive way to him?

Toward the end of the interview they said “ok well we’d like to offer you the position, but given your experience level we’re only going to offer $X”. I was feeling cheeky so I told them “ok, I was told this role would pay $Y but sure, I could put in $X amount of effort instead.”

They kind of laughed as if I was joking but when I kept a straight face they were like “are you serious?” and I said “Well yeah, if you’re gonna pay me on the low end of the scale I’d be an idiot to do the high end of the work, wouldn’t I?” 

Needless to say the interview didn’t go much further but it felt really good to give some of these LinkedIn weirdos a dose of reality. "

0,2024-07-04,My boss joined a cult and required me to participate as part of my job.,u/madebyapollo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dvmxt1/my_boss_joined_a_cult_and_required_me_to/,antiwork,"In the summer of 2018, I had just finished my freshman year of high school and needed a job. After being rejected from my local Publix, a classmate, hearing whispers about my amateur YouTube channel, put me in touch with the surprisingly young co-owner of a general contracting company looking for a new videographer.

As my Dad walked me into a sleepy home office for the first time, suspicious of the random guy I had been texting, we met a loud and energetic 25-year-old named Tony (not his real name). After being discharged from the army he moved into the shed behind his parent's house; a fact that he told me unabashedly. One failed coconut oil business later, he transitioned into working for his step-father's contracting company. Wasting no time, he declared himself  “in charge” and rebranded the entire company with a new name, logo, and ever-building social media presence.

The job was menial and tedious, but rewarding. The most distress I would ever encounter would be when interacting with Tony himself. Cutting people off mid-sentence, demeaning comments, and talking ill of other employees, I immediately noticed how tone-deaf and inappropriate he was. In one instance, I filmed a conversation between him and his stepfather where he brought up the urgent need to fire his own mother, who manned the office, describing her as “too incompetent”. For the sake of her feelings, I never included that clip in any final project. In another, he texted me in the middle of the school day commenting on the physical appearance of my teenage (no more than 16 years old) friend after I posted photos with her. 

I even endured my own insults where my Mexican heritage and sexuality were frequently poked fun at. It escalated when certain employees started questioning me about me and my parents' citizenship status along with Tony outright calling me a “B3aner” during a video shoot, in front of my best friend. As I came to terms with my own sexuality and became more open about it online (not at work), I was asked incredibly intrusive questions about my sex life and was shamed by Tony in front of other people in the office for using a gay dating app. Out of fear of appearing “too sensitive” or “hard to work with” I didn’t say anything.

Tony had a ruthless demeanor that was trying to mimic the motivational content creators that he idolized and, frankly, was obsessed with. Gary Vaynerchuck, Grant Cardone, Tony Robbins, you name it. They were on constant rotation whether in the office or in his free time. Tony even adorned our home office with a Gary Vaynerchuk portrait and quote that read something akin to “Stop thinking about it and just fucking do it”. However, this persona he had tried to copy lacked any depth. It was brash and direct, devoid of the savviness or empathy –ironically, traits Gary Vaynerchuk fervently advocates for.

Over time, my role at the company began to change. Instead of staying onsite for a project to showcase its progress, I would now be told to film daily vlogs for Tony’s personal YouTube channel, while filming videos for the construction company in the meantime. I was also tasked with traveling to Tony’s home to film parties and get-togethers that he hosted at his home and local nightclubs. As expected, these vlogs were extremely mundane, with Tony walking from one job site to the next, doing paperwork, and going to business networking clubs. Tony’s rule was to “film everything” and between the mundane, this rule helped result in some of the most interesting parts of my time at the company, specifically when I filmed a full-blown argument between Tony and his stepfather Bob (not his real name) in which he calls Bob a “victim” for asking Tony to contribute more to the service side of the business than marketing. 

In his videos, he would often make these very general, unrealistic, or outright false statements in an effort to exude the confidence of the content creators he was trying desperately to resemble. For example, in one video he toughly claims that “No one in my company is paid hourly.” while actively paying employees hourly. Or, more outlandishly, he claims in an employee training video that “The average crack addict makes 100K a year and they are homeless”. There was also a moment where, on his YouTube channel, he flaunted this “genius business move” to charge employees for training, a claim that was accurately described by commenters as illegal. Of course, this was never happening and the video was swiftly taken down.

And then he joined a cult. It's a pretty popular one that was invented by a science fiction writer and airs a huge Super Bowl commercial every year. Yeah...that one. 

Tony dove headfirst into the cult. Its courses are very self-affirming with little pushback, allowing for quick progress. As Tony began to build community, more people from the church started to join the company, replacing those who had left. It wasn’t long before I was told that I needed to take a course at the Tampa location to “perform my job better”. Reluctantly, I did. It took me 7 hours over the course of 2 days to complete the course. It was filled with rudimentary knowledge about keeping spreadsheets, information I would’ve been taught in a high school computer class, minus the blatant dig at socialism within the first couple of pages. But of course, that’s not what I was “really” there for.  

After putting me on an E-Meter, which required me to take my socks off and lotion up my hands, I was shuffled from room to room and repeatedly asked to buy a book for my own good. From one person to the next to a personality test, to a private room where a staff member called Tony on the phone to try and convince me. I eventually walked out after the staff member assigned to me asked if she was making me uncomfortable, apologized, and then asked me to sit back down. After this strange event, I made it evidently clear to Tony that I did not want to participate in the cult but this only followed in me being asked over and over again to “take a course” or “join a seminar”. Tony’s wife went as far as to tell me she sent a letter to my home address, which she got from the church, urging me to come back. I never saw this letter since I gave the church fake information when they asked. I constantly wondered what fueled their insistence on my attendance at the church, as it was so out of character for them. 

Being that I managed Tony’s YouTube channel, I had access to his email. After trying to approve a login on another device, I spotted an email from the cult. It was a confirmation of a commission payment that Tony had made from his referral of someone to the cult and their materials. I was taken aback as I had asked Tony before I took the course if he was making any commission from any purchases I may have made, to which he firmly said, no. In all honestly, I felt a bit betrayed. I saw this parasitic behavior as extremely disrespectful to me and my intellect as if he was trying to get back the money the business paid me for my job. That summer, I moved out of state and began to work remotely as a social media manager.

To no surprise, Tony began to talk about his experience with the cult via YouTube videos, at first filming them with me, but later on his own. With eye-catching titles like “Why I Joined (Cult Name), and then later “Why I Took Down My Videos On (Cult Name)”, they garnered more views than ever seen in the channel’s history. The reactions were universally negative, but Tony, on the outside, relished in it nonetheless. However, after a couple of videos, he decided to disable comments on the entire channel due to “trolls”.

This didn’t stop a very prominent YouTuber and Ex-Cult member from finding his videos and creating 20min+ commentary videos on Tony. These videos got tens of thousands of views and it wasn’t long before “(Cult Name)” and “lawsuit” were suggested when searching up the business or Tony’s name. You can imagine it’s an incredibly surreal experience to have 15 TV show-length videos dissecting the very outlandish claims of your boss. The pinnacle of these videos came when it was discovered that Tony’s wife had a popular p0rn page that he often participated in. The video has nearly 100K views. The page wasn’t a secret to myself or the company (it was one of the first things Tony ever told me about his life, and even then I didn’t think it was anything to gawk over), but online the company’s Instagram page and YouTube channel were flooded with lude comments referencing it.

During this time, Tony’s wife, Trish (also not her real name) was in charge of the entire marketing department. Back home, visiting family and working on some personal projects with friends, I received a call from her, informing me that I would be let go by the end of the week. Given that I had just been given a significant raise only a couple of weeks prior, I was shocked. She told me that they were going to fire the entire remote staff and to “not let the others know about it”. I found out later that this was a lie. I was beside myself and begged her to reconsider as I had told her about a planned move to New York just weeks before and had already signed a year-long lease for an apartment. She said “I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but I’m sure you could just get another job.” She told me it was a decision made by Tony, so I texted him, only to be told that “Trish’s decision was final.” They both lied about why they fired me and blamed one another when I asked for an explanation. I tried to circle back with Trish, but I received a text a day later thanking me for my loyalty and telling me to reach out if I ever had any questions or concerns.

I’m happy to say that I’m in a much better place today. I’m now living in Los Angeles and working as a video editor and director.  I’m aspiring to be a filmmaker and screenwriter. Since I was fired, Glassdoor and Indeed reviews have popped up exposing their ridiculous, almost call center-esque conduct. These posts describe their weekly hiring quotas, even though 28 of the 30 people they hire will leave by the month is over. It wouldn’t surprise me if Tony was actively recruiting those who stay for more than a month into the cult, making a dime off of every person he hires. 

It’s difficult to come to terms with my time in the company. Writing this was my attempt at closing this chapter of my life in my head. Tony could be insulting, frustrating, and incredibly uncompassionate, but he also gave me the confidence and encouragement to sell myself, delve more into photography, and reach out to musicians offering to direct their music videos. Sometimes I can even hear his cadence in how I speak in professional settings, being my first glimpse into how modern businessmen communicate. Tony’s family, specifically his mother and step-father, supported me personally & professionally, always willing to lend an ear and even helping me earn a scholarship to college. Human relationships are too complex to feel outright hatred or admiration for someone, but sometimes those conflicting feelings can make you doubt your own emotions. How could I feel this way, write these things about someone in this way who contributed so much to my life? He’s someone who helped me build connections and a career, but he also made racist impressions of my mom’s accent and tried to make money off of me by pressuring me into a cult. Was it worth it? Am I being too sensitive? Was my emotional teenage brain exaggerating the whole thing?

As for Tony, here’s how I feel. I feel as if his entire professional identity is plagiarised from the self-help “gurus” he admired. A recent tweet from Tony reads:

*“The uninspired will always say the truly inspired are nuts, take things too far, are too intense, are impossible to work with/for. If people are saying this about you but what you say/do works, DON’T LISTEN!!!! And get some people around you who believe in you and your mission.”*

I could only describe Tony as the uninspired he speaks about. His ego isn’t developed enough to ask himself for advice and opinions, so he inherited them from others, for better or for worse, in an effort to craft an identity of his own. He saw the fancy B-Roll they touted of sexy women and boats and planes and yearned for these objects of success in a way that prioritized the looks over the results. He yearned for respect and admiration in a way that screamed out his every insecurity. Everything from his internet persona to the codes of conduct at the company is plagiarised. He’s a compulsive liar who flaunts outlandish claims or He thrives on attention but rejects criticism or consequences. Negative comments on his behavior are just from “uninspired people” and should be ignored.  What little original thoughts he has resulted in nothing but incoherent ramblings, citing “something he heard” as his expertise. It was sad to me as a 15-year-old and it’s sad to me now. I wish for nothing but success for him in the future, but I hope I never have to have an experience like this in my life."

1,2024-07-04,Screwed out of holiday pay! Screenshots attached,u/SomeGalFromTexas,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dvn6m8/screwed_out_of_holiday_pay_screenshots_attached/,antiwork,"So at our place, if you are scheduled off on a holiday you get 8 hours of holiday pay, or prorated if you work less than 8 hours average. This is over and above any hours that you have worked during the week, even if you have worked 40 hours, and even if you have overtime. You can work 40 hours that week and you will get paid 48 hours. 

That is, if you are **scheduled OFF** on the day of the holiday. If you are scheduled to work on the holiday, you don't get the 8 hours. You get time and a half for the hours that you do work that day. If you work 8 hours, you get paid for 12. If you work 6 hours, you get paid for nine. Your so-called holiday pay is your time and a half. Somebody who works 8 hours gets 4 hours of holiday pay but somebody who works zero hours gets 8 hours of holiday pay.

Several of us got very pleased for a little bit when we checked our hours for the week on our time card app and saw that we had 8 hours of holiday pay added to our hours for the week. You can see the screenshot. Imagine how pissed off we are now that they took it away from us, and we only get the time and a half. For example, I worked an 8-hour shift. I get 4 hours of holiday pay. Two other head cashiers have the day off. They get paid 8 hours of holiday pay, plus the 38 to 40 hours that they worked for the week. We asked the manager on duty about this, and he confirmed that those of us who worked only get our time and a half, which for those of us who work 8 hours only works out to 4 hours of holiday pay, not the 8 hours that everybody who is off and eligible for the pay would be receiving. Eligible employees are those who have worked 6 months or more. I've been there two years, the other head cashier who was with me tonight has been there for 3 years. We are in the top benefits bracket so we qualify for holiday pay. We are full time so we are qualified for 8 hours. But because we worked today, we only get our time and a half which works out to 4 hours of holiday pay, not eight.

Can somebody please tell me how this makes any sense whatsoever? By the way, I'm posting these screenshots because I posted something about this earlier, and a few people could not get their head around it. They seem to think that I was misunderstanding, and that I would be pleased later to find the 8 hours on my paycheck. No, I'm pissed because the 8 hours was there and then it got taken away. They did that to everybody who works today.

As soon as I left, I texted one of the other ladies who worked with me, who is just as pissed off about it as I am, to see how she felt about the idea of joining or forming a union at our workplace. She's intrigued. I'm going to start floating the idea around. My employer cannot retaliate because discussing worker organization is protected in the workplace and it's highly illegal to dismiss somebody for discussing this topic. If I get fired, I'll have major grounds for a lawsuit and action against that company. I don't care if this is in Texas because now it becomes Federal. Of course Texas is employment at will and an employer can always make up a bogus reason to terminate if they don't like the idea of unionization, but I've got a very Flawless record right now at my workplace and if it suddenly became problematic and I have proof that I have discussed unionization or organized labor at the workplace, it might make things a little more uncomfortable for them. I'm going to try to make sure I have a lawyer in my back pocket before I get too far into this, but it's time for us to stand up. There are things going on there, but this is a Tipping Point."

This is a minimum wage (plus some tips) job at an ice cream store run by the most strict drill sergeant of a manager ever. No matter what I do it feels like it's never enough for him and he's just going to yell at me anyway. I'm already moving pretty fast in general but he always tells him to move faster. I make mistakes cuz I'm new (today is like my fifth day on the job) and I'm moving so fast & stressed during rushes and he yells at me that I'm doing things wrong like giving ppl too much ice cream, making errors at the register or elsewhere and OF COURSE I'm gonna make all these mistakes when I'm new, going fast and under immense stress. Did I mention that I have not gotten a single break during any of my shifts? Granted these aren't super long shifts most of them 3-5 hours which is legal sure but  he's always hounding us that we have to be doing something at all times and can't just stand around and talk 

If this kinda sounds like boomer behavior then you'd be absolutely right he almost always manages to fit in a comment along the lines of ""you kids these days don't know how to work hard..."" whenever he says that any of us aren't doing something to his liking. 

I almost had a panic attack in the middle of my shift today because of how stressed I was 90% of was caused by my manager yelling at me to move faster or that I wasn't doing something right. I cried when I got home and vented about this to my parents. A summer job at a fucking ice cream shop shouldn't be causing this level of stress and I'm gonna talk this over with my parents & friends tomorrow to get second opinions on what I should do but I really don't think I'm gonna talk to my boss and explain all this to him much less give him a precious 2 week notice before slamming my uniform on the counter and telling him I've had enough of his crap"

It’s a 2h commute for me to get here, and half the time I have nothing to do. Today, they didn’t even address me or ask what I had been working on. Most days (remember my 2h commute) they show up late with no prior warning or notice, meaning I’ve wasted all that travel time. It’s getting to a point where I feel used and wondering what is the point when I could just be working at my actual job to get money. I have learnt a bit but not much. With that being said there’s only three weeks left but Idk how much more I can take. BTW this is a voluntary internship, not through university or anything.

His tone was aggressive and I felt like he was targeting me all week. that was confirmed because he told me that him and the head chef had been talking about me using my phone. I used my phone to reply to a family message (im in another country with a different time zone) I rarely get to talk to my family so I just sent a message back but this was noted and brought up to him to use against me. 

  
He says that I have a bad attitude towards him and could not give examples. He said that I slow down service despite being the only person working on the floor today. He did not help out on the floor, he stayed behind the till and then polished cutlery and then left. I greet customers, I seat them, I get their drinks orders, I get their food orders, refills and make sure they leave happy when I take their payments. He told me that the only good thing about me is my good report with customers as if I don't do my job very well. Ive been a waiter for 5 years, I know how to do my job and there are people who approach me and ask if I am the manager because of the sheer workload I take on. So to have somebody who has been there for little to no time tell me that I only have one good value in my work place is very frustrating. 

I keep my interactions with him short because he is incredibly rude when he talks to me. There's no please, warmth or help that comes from him. He takes on the easy jobs and leaves everything else for me. Whenever we close, he cashing up for an hour and comes down to tell us that we need to hurry up and leave but refuses to help out. Today he asked me to clean the bathrooms and I said I have a migraine and the chemicals we use are really strong and will make my migraine worse. (im still recovering from the flu and have severe migraines and light sensitivities). His response was ""SO?"" and he started laughing, I asked ""is that funny"" and he said ""no"" and kept laughing. I couldn't believe his response esp after the meeting where he is bewildered why I keep my interactions with him short. in the meeting he told me to bring up issues that I have with him (I didn't say anything because I already had and he ignored them or said he couldn't do anything about the issues because of a lack of staff). most of the meeting I stayed quiet because I knew he wanted to make me feel angry and say something for him to use against me. I gave him nothing, just apologised and thanked him for his time but im furious. im furious that I have been targeted esp after all the hard work I have done in this place. 

  
I don't know whether or not to go to HR but im aware that he has more power than me and that they'll likely fire me. But before I am let go, I want to let HR know the type of person they have hired in a manager position because he places nice to men and his managers but is very rude to the women who work on the floor with him.

What was the point? When I interviewed, there was a whole lot of “oh yeah, we treat people like humans!” Bullshit, now I have no income. How tf am I supposed to pay my bills? I have nowhere else to live if I lose my apartment. I don’t have family to depend on.

2,2024-07-05,"I haven't been paid in 90+ and counting, and yet I feel still like the bad guy for not working tomorrow.",u/Beastreaux22,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dvrfgh/i_havent_been_paid_in_90_and_counting_and_yet_i/,antiwork,"I just needed to tell someone and I guess hoped I would just get some advice?

For context I'm a 1099, or contract worker, so not even an employee of the company.  I work in the tourism industry where I pick up tourist and take them around to America's national parks, big cities, and other tourist spots on trips anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks. The company I primarily get work from allows me to live in their ""guide house"" as kind of a subsidization of not paying super well. When I started they basically said: ""It doesn't make sense for you to move out here and pay for a place to rent or live if you're going to be on the road all the time"".  All of this is important later.

  
So this company hasn't given me a paycheck since April 1. Before each trip I have a contract saying that they will pay me within 14 days of me turning in the paperwork (expense reports, receipts, driving logs, etc.). I now have a trip I'm supposed to be doing tomorrow, and I still haven't been paid, and they owe me more than $6k. I called my ""boss"" a couple days ago and just told him ""you're gonna have to find someone else to do this trip because I'm not doing anything until I get paid"" and he told me that he talked to the owner of the company and he should be starting on my paperwork on Friday, ergo tomorrow.  The problem with that is 

A) It's already been 90 days and there is absolutely no excuse to go so long without being paid. Plus there was no communication what so ever from the owner that it might a little delayed or anything.

B) I was already told I was supposed to have money in my account on Monday, and that didn't happen.

C) If he starts my paperwork tomorrow, I wont get paid until Monday at the earliest.

I guess I should also mention, that while this is the longest I have ever waited to be paid, and I have always eventually been paid, this has been a reoccurring thing, where I have to constantly pester the owner to pay me.  Another shitty thing is that I use my own money to tip the 3rd party guides we use at different sites, and I get a per diem for food every day that they reimburse me for, but the reimbursement hits at the same time as the paycheck, so essentially I have given the company an interest free loan of my money for the last 3 months. I also just pay for my meals with my credit card, but I haven't been getting any money to pay it off, so if I hadn't used my savings I would be getting charged interest for the money I essentially lent the company. Also I don't want to sue them for breach of contract because again I live at their house and don't want to ""bite the hand that feeds me"" and also I just don't have money and maybe I'm just ignorant but feel like it would be a lot of trouble for potentially being paid within the next few days.

My confliction comes because, my ""boss"" is actually a really good dude, and I have enjoyed working for/with him, and I really hate to screw him over like this, because I really don't think there is anyone else available to take over this trip, especially because I only told him a couple days in advance, and he's not responsible or in charge of payroll. Also because I'm supposed to be taking a group of 10 foreign tourists tomorrow, and I'm potentially fucking up their vacation and a once in a lifetime opportunity for them coming to the states and seeing our amazing national parks.  I can't help but feel like I'm being selfish and that I've already waited this long to be paid, so what is another few days? But at the same time, WTF. How do they expect me to keep working for them and not be paid? I'm sure the owner, and the owner's dad and brother who also work for the company haven't had missed paychecks. I'm sure my ""boss"" hasn't either. I know some of the other guide's haven't been paid consistently either, but non of them have been waiting more than 3 months. So anyway, now I'm just really nervous that I'm fucking up these people's trip and that I'm gonna get kicked out of the house. I don't pay rent and never signed anything to live there so I'm not sure what kind of renter's rights or squatters rights I have, but the ""caretaker"" of the property is the owner's brother, and he's a real son of a bitch, and it just makes me nervous that I'm gonna come home from the gym or something, and the all the locks will be changed.

  
Anyway,  I don't really know what I'm expecting from this post, I tried to organize it and not ramble too much, but I just don't know what to do, and I just felt like I needed to tell someone. I know I need to find a new job, but the fact they pay for my housing and all the utilities, makes it really hard to move on to something else, especially because all the money that I should be getting will essentially just go towards paying off all the debt I wracked up from not being paid."

6,2024-07-05,Finally stood up to employers crap ,u/CV2nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dvs5nl/finally_stood_up_to_employers_crap/,antiwork,"Granted, I have not been the best employee. I've got surgical damage in my pelvis (very rare complication that almost killed me) and I prewarned them 4 months prior to starting and even signing contracts that I was very unwell, so there was an opportunity to pull out or deem me as unfit for post. 

Instead, they ignored every single communication that didn't involve me making them money. When I postponed their contractual training programme due to pain for a few months, they said nothing. And waited until im near the end of my contract/probation period to inform me that it's impacted my contractual agreement for employment, months later. It's being used as a reason to not offer me any work (yey for zero hour contracts) for the next 10 months and instead send me on unpaid training for 3 months, and then bring me back in next year when I'm ""healthy"" and completed the training, where I'm basically tied to them for work to pay for my training. And they've also reduced the hours of my contract in 10 months time. 

Every request to discuss my health has been ignored. My line manager even asked me if my surgery was a success after I'd sent him 3 emails prior to starting about almost dying. HR sent me on an hour long training course about setting up my work station and organising my desk instead of purchasing a $20 support cushion when I said I was struggling to sit down without pain or walk and wanted to work from home, they even kindly arranged a standing desk so I could stay after hours (unpaid.) My line manager bought one and then kept it in his office, ignoring any emails I sent to ask how I can collect it to actually use it. I booked off a hospital appointment 7 weeks in advance and got ignored and penalised for coming in half a day. I tripped over on my way to work due to the damage spreading into my sciatica nerve, and was late in due to limping on one foot. I got told I was unprofessional for coming in late. 

Then, I found out my hospital appointment had been put through on the system as sickness, which despite being onsite, attending meetings, and filling in timesheets, continued to be marked as an ongoing abscene, so I lost a whole month of pay. I took off last week as sickness. I was reaching my limit and my fall had cost me a week of mobility. My line manager put through my absence to HR as 2 weeks instead of one, requesting I send in a new fitnote to replace my doctors original one which informs them they need to send me to occupational health, a request they'd be delaying from me for over a month to action. 

When I informed them the dates were wrong, they wanted me to override my fitnote from my doctor by filling in my own sickness documentation, making the absence look like a sesperate issue that was unrelated to their lack of support to my health. I was informed I needed to attend a return to work meeting before I was allowed to come back, which never happened. So I didn't go in. As you can imagine they then changed their policy and stated the documentation wasn't required for my return to work or the meeting. My manager is now calling me, and requesting calls daily to arrange my return to work. I work for this place part-time. I have other jobs and commitments, and this dude wants me to call him outside my working hours they haven't even paid me properly for. 

So yesterday I emailed to propose a suggestion, either I go through my union (they're already involved to an extent) or they correct my pay and allow me to leave with a good reference. I know it's not much, and as it's a long term condition that was declared I could ask for more. But i just want to be done with this, paid for my time and focus on my health. My recovery has been massively impacted because of this job, and I just CBA to go through corporate politics to fight some sort of discrimination payout. I just want to leave, and take the reference for when I'm better to find someone else who is better. It's the first time I've proposed something like this in my career, and I hope it pays off and they accept so I can celebrate! 

Anyway, whoever stuck around for this long post, thanks for being here lol.

They act as if it’s more professional to act this way and unprofessional, even borderline rude, if I speak plainly. I am just trying to get info out as clearly and efficiently as possible. 

But it also doubles as corporate virtue signaling. If you talk like that, you’re pretty much stating that you’re a part of the corporation and here to stay and play the game/ladder climb.

I don’t know it just feels very kiss-assy and fake. I hate a lot of things about capitalism but this one bothers the living shit out of me for some reason. Probably cause I have to read it/listen to it constantly "

First of all, I hated my job. I was always treated unfairly and said yes to everything. I actually disliked people more than my job itself and felt constantly unhappy. However, I was good at freelancing and blogging because there were no offices or startup environments to deal with.

I have about 2 months ahead of me. Currently, I am unemployed (2-3 months). Therefore, I want to start a business. However, I face some challenges due to focus problems, and I am on medication for that. I **also have to deal with anxiety and depression. Please consider my situation before making any harsh comments.**

Here’s a bit of my background as a Software Developer and what I’m considering:

• **Upwork:**

• Since May, I have earned $850.

• Completed 2 jobs with good reviews.

• primarily a frontend developer.

• Rising Talent.

• On the verge of getting a 100% success rate on Upwork.

• Earn around $400 monthly from Upwork.

• However, this is not enough to support myself living in Europe.

• **Blogging:**

• Decided to start a blog website.

• Plan to write about mental health and have a small store in the future.

• My website, Coding Life Mindfully, is live.

• I enjoy writing and blogging.

• All content is my own work.

• I can develop templates for websites and plan to add a store.

• **Own Project:**

• Participated in the Microsoft Startup program.

• Tried to launch a Flutter project (mobile app development).

• The project is niche and based on my experiences.

• Couldn’t succeed due to the need for a team and financial constraints.

• Haven’t had a full-time job since May 15.

• **Full-Time Job Search:**

• Struggling to find a job despite having a good CV.

• Haven’t been invited to interviews.

• Need a full-time job but can’t seem to secure one.

• No offense, I think the reasons here are that I come from another country, I am a woman and I am directly eliminated when they look at my name

I want to become my own boss in the future, but I need short-term financial stability. I am looking for a plan that allows me to sustain myself without constantly shifting my focus elsewhere.

Any advice or insights from another perspective would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you."

My coworker told him that I’m printing out my report and was only briefly talking to her while the printer was printing out my documents but it was too late. He went and called my other boss and who’s currently on a work trip and told him that I’m not doing any work but am chatting to coworkers instead.

I am almost a senior but I am really struggling since I have bad anxiety and honestly would prefer not to work in a corporate job at all or at least just be left alone to do my work (art) but instead I am in tons of meetings with leads where I feel like I have to proof myself in order to get a promotion I don’t want but feel like I have to want (which makes my anxiety worse and makes me hate this job) and when I speak up and try to give some input there is 90% of the time someone who is trying to shut me down instantly in some condescending way. Obviously this doesn’t happen with everyone. My manager is great for example and listens to what I have to say but a lot of guys in my field, especially when they are higher up, just straight up don’t seem to listen to anything I say. Honestly I don’t give enough shit about my job, since it really puts down my mental health and I am used to people just straight up ignoring what I say. I don’t care anymore  to fight these people on random crap that I think would improve x y z. If they don’t think my input is valid whatever.
But I am honestly so confused. There is a woman in my team who is lower level (in terms of seniority) than me and she is doing tons of extra work, is really outspoken about topics and passionate and has more knowledge than most people in my team or even in leadership but she has butted heads with some people that she gave valid criticism to but apparently the people in leadership have been  talking shit about her in messages sent to the wrong teams chat and they have denied her a promotion many times. On all account I feel like she would be a better fit for a senior role than me but no one in the leadership team seems to like her. I talk to her regularly and she is a reasonable person so this really bothers me. If there is a male only team in leadership do they even want for women to speak up? To me it seems like they want someone who agrees to their bs and brings up ideas that don’t question the status quo. I am in my probation period and was hired as an (almost) senior and I just don’t know anymore if I have to be outspoken or not. Maybe it sounds stupid but I just want to keep this job doing my work well and at the moment I am scared of doing too little or too much.

I caught a pretty nasty cold about two weeks ago, and it kept me in bed for a week. For whatever reason the cold didn't want to go away, and I couldn't return to work if I was still contagious since I work with the public. I called out every day for my entire work week. On the final day I needed to call out, my manager informed me that I would need to visit a doctor to complete a ""Return to Work Evaluation form"" which states that I'm healthy enough to return to work.

I asked my manager if I could complete this form without a doctor, and they simply refered me to a walk-in clinic. Called HR immediately after and asked if I could not complete the form since I have no insurance and would rather not pay \~$100 to visit a doctor only to be told I no longer have a cold. HR told me my manager was well within their right to request a form as it's part of my work policy and I had been sick for 6 days straight when counting my weekend.

Maybe it's a stupid reason to quit a job, but I really can't afford a doctor's visit like this. I don't have any major problems with my job, so far they had been quite accommodating and more than reasonable since it's a government job. There was a month where I missed almost two entire weeks because I had to deal with getting my stuff stolen, and the added stress, and everything was fine.

But now that I was unlucky enough to have caught a cold that was strong enough to keep me in bed for a week, I need to get proof that I don't have a serious illness that would prevent me from working?

I really, really don't understand this policy. And it's something I can't afford completing, so I feel like I just have to quit. While it feels like a very dumb reason to quit a decent job, I also feel like I'm forced to do so.

Am I wrong for wanting to quit?"

He only asked me 4 interview questions but even was saying how he hates asking these questions and that they don't mean anything. 1 of the questions he didn't even make me answer as it was on my resume so he just wrote ""see resume"" on the question. I didn't feel grilled or pressured at all, it was just like having a conversation with another human being.

I've been to other interviews the past couple months and they were the complete opposite. Super formal, asking like 5-7 interview questions along with just asking me about myself and stuff, asking me to fill out questionnaires or perform tasks, etc. Just don't get why it ever has to be that way, I can't stand those types of interviews, it's not necessary. 

I understand for more skilled jobs like being a doctor or police officer, obviously they need to know if you're really interested in the work and have qualifications and stuff, but I can assume you no jobs I've had an interview for have required much skill that can't be learnt with a bit of training.

I work in Healthcare, andt the time I had been in my specific position at company A for over 5 years. I had former coworker, who was working at company B ask me for my resume. She said company B was looking to grow a program, requiring staff with my specific experience. Company B HR reaches out and immediately interviews me. I tell them my salary expectations and point out that my current role is fully remote, and that the new salary would have to have a decent enough increase to entice me to take a office role. (Obvious foreshadowing)

They have me do multiple zoom interviews with different levels of management. Each interview goes great, but I always make a point to mention that I did not apply for this role. I was an internal referral, and that I'd need incentive to leave a position that I wasn't actively looking to give up. Everyone agrees.

I eventually get a follow-up call from HR. Management thinks I'd be a great fit, they want me on the team, and they offer me... my current salary. I politely tell the HR rep that all along the way, I had mentioned my salary expectations prior to me considering this position. He confirms this and says he'll talk to the director and get back to me.

I get a call a the next day from the HR rep.   A new offer is up. They offer me my current salary, but I can get a 4%  raise down the line once I've gotten certain certifications. This time, I can't help myself. I chuckle and politely say that it's a bit insulting. I have made my requirements clear and that I would have preferred to have avoided the multiple interviews if this was the known end result. I thanked him and wished them luck.

Multimillion logistics US company. I got put on a PIP for admittedly my own two blunders that I fixed in less than 24 hours. Being a longtime lurker in this subreddit, I knew that PIPs are, 99.8% of the time, just a paper trail for when the higher-ups want to sack someone, so I boldly asked my manager if that's the case. Twice. In both instances, my manager assured me that she ""only wants what's best for me"", ""to whet my skill"", and ""ensure that my work routine is efficient."" The PIP document even said as much: ""<...> in case sufficient improvement \[throughout these six weeks\] is not found, the PIP period can be extended.""

So, I worked my ass off for these six weeks. My manager kept nitpicking because she's a micromanaging monster: ""you left an internal note in the wrong category"", ""you spent 10 minutes doing a task that normally takes 7"", ""the pick-up range should be 'from 09:00 to 17:00', not 'by 17:00'"", and alike. Disgruntedly, I took that 'feedback' and integrated it into my work. I had a gut feeling that my manager was about to blow these mini-issues out of proportion during the final evaluation but thought: if the PIP document stated that the period could be extended, then that meant that if I failed my evaluation, I would be given more time. According to her, I was in no danger of being fired. Right? R*iiiii*ght?

🤣

Well, the evaluation came, and I was given an offer to leave willingly with a three-week severance. I was ""too combative/resistant"" to feedback and ""questioned the guidelines"". Evidently, the PIP *could've* been extended but they (my manager had roped in her two coworkers to be her liaison/witnesses) chose not to — that was their defense when I called out the fact the original document said nothing about a dismissal.

Our labor code says that a dismissal via a failed PIP can be initiated by the employer, but said PIP has to last at least two months long. Mine was six weeks. Is there anything I can do to stay? I like the salary, the shift, and the bosses who actually give me my tasks. With me being on the spectrum, I am *not* looking forward to job hunting yet again...

Anyway, fuck PIPs. Fellas, if you're ever put on one, start applying to other jobs stat. Your days at that company are numbered."

The next day the assistant had me sign a write up dor taking too long on my lunch she was apologetic about it but it didn't make me feel better. The next week I told them I was moving to Europe and quite lol I still live in the same town today. I know I can write people up for pretty much anything but I would never as manager today. Just wanna know what you guys think.

He just started doing it this year. Now I don't mind the idea of eating food at the desk, it's the part where he's still giving me assignments or having me report to him while he is on break. 

It used to be he would leave and I wouldn't have to deal with his BS for an hour. His break would essentially be a break for me FROM HIM. But it's getting annoying having to either be questioned on things I already did or hear about trivial office drama.

I'm trying to not be at my desk so much by looking for random things to fix during his break but I can't be gone for a full hour.

Anyone else have a boss that wants to keep working literally their ENTIRE shift like this?"

I need some clarification on this new $844 minimum that was proposed for 7/1. I submitted a wage claim that I was not paid for a holiday closure, because it is a PTO benefit after your 90 day probationary period according to HR. I am salary exempt. When I called to follow up on the claim, I was told not only is that allowed, the new threshold only applies to non exempt employees, otherwise I can expect the $684 minimum and the employer is doing nothing wrong. 

I was under the impression if I am available for work and the office is closed anyway, it should be a full weeks pay. Well sounds like they can propose a salary on an offer letter above the legal limit, and drop me to the legal limit when it's a holiday, since I am still paid the minimum requirement to stay Salary Exempt. 

So does that mean after 7/1, they do not have to up it to $844, it stays the original weekly $684? I'm in PA if the state is needed. I appreciate any clarification before I make any more unnecessary stinks and deal with retaliation or something. Thank you. "

No notice, just no job next month. Great. I got broke and had lots of debts, but that's okay; life goes on.

Since then, I've been applying for hundreds of opportunities in Linguistics, AI, and related fields, as these have been my main experiences in the past (five years now), but without any success whatsoever. I hardly get interviewed, and when I do, they ghost me forever. In the meantime, there was a freelance annotation job opportunity. Still, it was so ridiculously underpaid that I made an incredible amount of twenty (that's right, 20) dollars in three weeks. 

I have a BSc degree in applied linguistics and work experience, and it feels like all of that serves me for absolutely nothing right now. I am profoundly questioning all of my choices so far, wondering why the hell I chose to go into the corporate world, and now without a clue of what to do to start anew. What do I want to do? What can I take in to afford life (it isn't a 9-5 routine, I'm sure!)? How do I even start applying for jobs for which I don't have the experience or the knowledge? I know being lost is part of the process, but I  feel hopeless now.

280,2024-07-05,I quit a job after 1.5 years because they wouldn't work with my schedule and give me a dollar raise because of inflation. They have since been through 4 new employees in 6 weeks. ,u/Prudent-Link3891,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dw1352/i_quit_a_job_after_15_years_because_they_wouldnt/,antiwork,"I worked a low level job managing inventory for a small retail operation for 1.5 years. I was a consistent and dependable employee throughout this time and shouldered a lot of the burden of the physical work because I was one of the largest and strongest people in the building (my managers, who earned more than me, always asked me to do these tasks because they are small/weak people). This caused some wear on my body including back pain I was having trouble dealing with considering my insurance situation (this job included almost no benefits). 

I asked for a basic, $1 raise to help combat inflation considering I'd been on the same low wage for around 8 months as inflation rose steadily (2021-2). I also asked them to reduce my hours to roughly 25 hours a week to accommodate my new school schedule since I am returning to college in August to get my sorry ass some real skills. I was simply trying to get Thursday/Fri/Sat off to work Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu... not like my available hours were all over the place. They denied these requests without even talking to me in person and I quit the same day they let me know out of pure disgust with the situation. 

They have since hired four new people... **Person #1** Was a 19 year old guy who only completed one day before he realized how much the job sucks. **Person #2** was a recovering homeless fellow who seemed like a good fit but was fired a few weeks later for undisclosed reasons (I actually have no idea). **Person #3** quit because of stomach issues she was dealing with. **Person #4** was fired because he no call/no showed 3 days in a row... All of these people have left or been fired in the 5 or 6 short weeks I have been gone.

It is actually mind boggling how much companies are willing to spend in time and money on new employees (background checks, training, etc.) because they valued me so little and didn't want to even discuss a small raise despite the physical wear my body had been under. The person who is in charge of hiring/firing is a rather well of woman whose husband owns his own business so I'm not entirely sure she sees us as worth negotiating with because apparently this is a low skill job or something. I literally cannot stop grinning about their misfortunes, even though I feel a little bad at the same time because I still have friends at that job. 

Ah, capitalism. Capitalism has taught me to value my labor and my body, negotiate on my own behalf, and never relinquish my negotiating power no matter how (*theoretically)* easy my labor is to replace. I have now mostly replaced my income from that job from the ebay store I started. If or when I work for other people again, it will be for people who value my labor and are well aware of the fact that I can go elsewhere and work for their competitors if they don't want me (thinking about a tech role in the medical field more seriously now because of the healthcare benefits).

The manager told me to come in for training yesterday. The training itself was fine but there are some questionable practices. I haven't been given anything to sign yet, haven't even been talked to about some kind of contract. 

Some of the other questionable things include:
- Manager called me on a holiday to book the interview and wanted me to come in same day
- Interview was 4 questions long. Took 10 minutes total (manager also left with no warning half way through and came back about 5 minutes later. That is included in the total interview time)
- Manager was upset when he asked my availability and I couldn't drop everything for training
- Multiple items on the menu, including bar drinks are made by the servers (no bartender)
- Supposedly minimum wage but the manager ignored my question when I asked about compensation
- Servers provide their own pen and paper to take orders and must provide their own cash float, paid back at the end of shift (if there is cash available) or put on a list to be paid back later (undisclosed amount of time)
- Booked me for a training shift then cut it short upon realizing there was no one who could train me (everyone was either training someone, in training, or hadn't been there long enough to be training someone)

I'm just getting a really bad feeling about this job and I'm not sure if this is even a trustworthy position. At this point I feel like the manager is taking advantage of me. Any advice would be much appreciated!"

Honest to God, if I were a betting person, I would think if a business asks for checks to be mailed to a P.o. box that all checks would go there.

23,2024-07-05,Successful Revenge,u/westwordy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dw4dlz/successful_revenge/,antiwork,"I just shared my one antiwork story about an interview I had in the past, I figure I'd might as well share my favorite story involving a small but successful attempt at revenge.

About 6+ years ago, I work in Healthcare and I was working for this one particular group at the time that had multiple locations across parts of my state. When I was initially interviewed, they mentioned that the position had a home location that I'd work from and I'd have to travel around 10% of the time to do some outside office and patient facing. They also emphasized that they also provide substantial bonuses each year. (I was a glass half full kind of idiot then)

I take the position. Do what is needed. Things seem to go alright. The management don't really give the best direction of how they want the department to operate, but no biggie. We make it work. As time goes on the director and manager can be course about certain reports they want, but had never thought us how to do, nor told us they even wanted them from the start. I soon began to learn that the director can be hot and cold at times, but I'd have to read her mind to figure out wtf she wanted before they even asked for it. Layer #1 to this shit sandwich

A few months pass and we are now informed that main office is now moved to a different town, about 25 minutes away. Heavy morning traffic, and no street parking. Fun. Not only do we now have to change my primary, we also have to visit other offices 60% of the time. Mind you, these offices are 30-45min from our original site. Oh, and there is no compensation for travel, and I have to get there on my own time.  Layer #2 complete

I proceed to travel to these locations every day. All involve paying for parking. (I find a way to travel on the company's dime, and get accounting to cover the parking cause fuck them). Eventually the year comes to and end and we receive our bonuses for all our hard work. And we get....$250. # 3 shit sandwich completed

After that. I plotted my exit strategy asap. I started applying everywhere, and happen to get a much better job offer close to home. In the meantime, I become a busy bee. I become an even better employee. I start a project to help the company track lost data/filings. I used this project to immediately demand a meeting with my director and demand a respectable bonus for the work I had and have done and that 250 was an insult, and that I've been doing all this travel that I never agreed to and ahe refused to reimburse. After negotiating, she agrees to give me and additional $1250. I request it to be paid out immediately, which she surprisingly does. 

The instant that check cleared, I sent in my resignation effective immediately. Got a nice paid week off before starting my new job, which came with sick days and way more vacation days as well. It wasn't a huge win, but  glad I got to give a figurative fuck you on the way out. 

Bonus story:  A coworker told me the day I quit, the director held a 3 hour meeting over how and why such a good employee would leave like that. That she, ""high hopes and plans"" for me in the department and was asking my other coworkers what they thought caused me to leave. They told her I brought up the reasons at every meeting and she ignored them.  Worked out though. It got my former coworker a raise, since they were afraid she'd quit too."

I don't care what anyone claims, we all know the truth. You have to be a special kind of evil to work in HR to begin with. HR are literal devils. Literally every single HR person I've had to deal with (except for men) has supported and proven my suspicion. They're literally all the same. The stereotype and that everyone hates HR doesn't come from nowhere. They all love history for some reason. Many of them have degrees in politics and history or other liberal arts degrees. Then they wonder why everyone hates them, is suspicious of them and even leaves companies because of them. HR is dominated by unempathetic, emotionless, unintelligent, controlling, power-tripping, narcissistic women that want to live out their power trips because they have such fragile egos. These women could as well become dominas. They get offend and their feelings hurt by every little stupid thing or remark, they constantly look out for every minor mistake you make and try to twist your words and one-up you and belittle you and your accomplishments constantly. They got liberal arts degress and go to HR because they have no skills and can't do shit with these degrees. They get paid a shit ton of money without having to do any actual physical or mentally demanding work with a false sense of having power over others. They don't really have power, they just do the payroll but they want to insert themselves into everything and host useless meetings to feel important and justify their existence. They know that their job is worthless and useless because they are of no use to workers or society as a whole. They could do honest and dignified work that contributes to people and society like for example essential work like retail but they choose HR because it pays more.

Every techie in my company has beef with the HR lady and we literally all hate her because of her absolutely vile and disgusting character. Her degree is in acting and dramatics lmao. Very fitting because she's the most fake and dramatic person I've ever met. And she's a bad actor at that too. Probably why no one hired her when she applied for acting roles in her youth and then ended up in HR. She is constantly acting, lying, scheming, accusing people of things, belittling coworkers and their achievements, pitting coworkers against each other, making up petty lies, lies straight into our faces while grinning even though we can all tell she's so obviously lying right into our faces. Her acting is literally SO bad but she is absolutely blatantly shameless about it. She takes every sentence you say literally and twists and uses every single word you say against you and gets angry and offended over the most stupidest, petty things, lashes out and screams at you. She wants everything done her way but makes sure you have to jump through hoops so that nothing is ever good enough. If you don't agree with her or don't say what she wants to hear, she gets offended and angry and starts arguments where she talks like a waterfall, screams, interrupts you, won't listen to your perspective, won't try to understand you and throws passive-aggressive insults at you. She's so insecure, bitter and miserable and wants to bring others down to her level so that she can feel better about her life and herself. She's absolutely pathetic. Literally nobody talks to her anymore unless they absolutely have to. She thinks so hightly of herself, as if she's God's gift or something but she's literally the most low EQ and IQ person I've ever met. We all grey rock her because she's literally a narcissist that ruins the company. The engineers, who were usually kind, polite and empathetic are now depressed and dead inside. No one smiles anymore, no one talks anymore because HR will twist and get hung up on every little word and take everything literally. Turnover is at an all time high because of her and she literally has the audacity to wonder why and that she isn't the problem. No self refelction at all, typical narcissist.

I wanted to share a most recent positive experience I recently had navigating ADA accommodations in the workplace. As someone with a learning disability, I've always valued workplaces that respect and support employees' needs under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Recently, I applied for a post office job that I was really excited about, but I knew that certain aspects of the job schedule could potentially impact my ability to perform effectively due to my disability. So, during the interview process, I decided to advocate for myself and requested a flexible schedule as a reasonable accommodation by submitting a schedule A documentation.

I outlined how a flexible schedule would enable me to manage my health condition while still fulfilling my job responsibilities effectively. I also provided documentation from my healthcare provider to support my request.

I'm happy to say that the company was supportive and understanding. They engaged in an open dialogue with me, and we were able to agree on a schedule that works for both their operational needs and my personal health requirements. This experience not only reinforced my confidence in the company's commitment to inclusivity but also highlighted the importance of advocating for oneself under the ADA."

I had a negative reaction to them that caused me to seem monotone and bored, but I was very much alert. 

In that time, I was moved to a manufacturing role in my company, more than anything because the shift was more feasible to meet with my therapist. My trainer commented that I seemed bored, and I told the truth, that I was reacting negatively to a medication, that it would take a day or two to flush it out of my system, then I would be good as new. 

Well on Friday of last week, my supervisor pulled me aside and told me that my trainer had told him everything, and that they would need to reevaluate my ability to do my job after a “minor injury” (I cut the tip of my finger with a pair of scissors and needed a bandaid.) and proceeded to tell me that I would have this week off with pay, while the company evaluated my mental health and medication status, without me there. 

On Monday I received word that it was no issue! I would come back on Monday of next week with no issues, but my trainer would need to keep a closer eye on me. No problemo. Except apparently no. I got a phone call today saying actually……. They changed their minds. I had to go back to work for my old facility, and the old shift that I disliked strongly.

I’m usually such a pacifist. I don’t like confrontation so I just kind of didn’t say anything as I was told that it was nice to meet me then they hung up. What am I supposed to do? Why did they just spring this on me?

LLBean- sincerely that was really terrible. "

I've come to the realization that I fucking hate some PM or other person with an excessively loose concept of my job (systems engineer, specifically) setting unrealistic timelines, ignoring me telling them so, and then calling me out about how close we are to timelines despite the only reason we aren't behind is me putting in dumb hours and my 15+ years of experience allowing me to get past almost all roadblocks without outside assistance.

  
This isn't the first job I've had like this. I'm not the only one in my type of position I've heard voice very similar experiences. I'm just fucking done with the Rat Race.

  
So far my idea is to get my Real Estate license, and hope I can manage to sell enough houses, jumping into it full time once I get 1-2 sales under my belt. I also feel like I absolutely have to be missing some basics for finding ways to invest and create passive income.

I've gotten to work with some really great people 1st in news production then in commercial. We had managers who cared about the employees like Aaron Cowman (rip) and Todd Lacey(rip). And Lindsey Hopkins who is just amazing, not only as a leader but as a person. I appreciate you all and the experiences I've had along the way. But as we talk about along the way, let's talk about the culture shift at KGUN. In news stations across the world the goal is #1 or bust. Not here though. Here we strive for anything but. News director, all the way up to the GM have been fired for poor performance... Not here though, here we are ""happy"" just getting to play tv. And who suffers due to poor numbers, us the workers. We are the first to be chopped when it's time to restructure. How does this translate you might ask. Well talk to anyone in sales, when a station is #1 they can charge like it's number 1.... Not here though. So if there's no money being made then there's no money for raises (tho the pile of work keeps growing)or even to keep you on. But hey, don't worry cause we are going to have a pizza party. This station has suffered in an already tough broadcast environment. It has suffered from bad management in a time where we can't afford bad management. My reason for leaving a job I once loved with people I'd consider family is based solely on those bad management decisions. It is NOT only about being the best for the community, in this business you need to be the best IN the community. Now I know it seems like all I have is complaints, so here is the solution, if management cares about the employees like they claim to and if they care about the communities like they claim to and the product which should be top priority than maybe they will find a way to fix the bad culture and broken system that's in place now. But since all they care about is the next promotion, the bigger salary bump and whatever fancy car they are driving, they probably won't. So to the employees, good luck in all of your future endeavors. You guys are better than this place!

Whatever happened to it?  Did our Petrodollar Overlords shut it down after some napkin calculations on how much they'd lose per quarter??  

It wasn't enough anyway.  We should push for a 3 day work week.  That is the only sane work/life balance.  Even 3x13 hours is a way better life than 5x8 (with 30 minutes stolen for ""lunch"" with no opt out)  although 3x8 is the true max of what we should be doing.

Also, let's normalize refusing to accept commuting.  A worker is better off working for less money closer to home.  commute time is lost time unless you sit on a comfy train and can sleep or do stuff.  Not owning a car is something to be admired and aspired to.  I'd rather be poor and not suffer 3 hours commuting every day to be slightly less poor (or more poor depending on parking gas and all that joy of car ownership)

  
That is all.  Thank you for your time.  now put it on your cover letter.  ""I am seeking a 3 or 4 day work week (consecutive not broken up!!!!), absolutely no 5s!!!""

Last week they put a notice up for 2 new roles, one higher for people who have an A level in a feild related to health and social care and one lower leveled job for entry level work. 
I applied for the higher position as I have a degree and an a level in health and social care and seemed to meet all the requirements they specified.

At the start of this week my supervisor got in contact and gave me a sealed envelope telling me it was an exciting interview offer. On opening it up it was for the Lower position that I didn't even apply for, when asking if this was a  typo they confirmed that it was for the lower position. 

I've never had this sort of thing happen before so I just don't even know how to feel about it.

4967,2024-07-05,Company wouldn't honor the agreed upon days off when hiring me(with medical documentation). I quit and cost them their quarterly bonuses and a $350k contract.,u/microwavable_rat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dwc2v3/company_wouldnt_honor_the_agreed_upon_days_off/,antiwork,"I've spent the last few years working in fabrication, running some very specialized machines(industrial laser cutters for sheet metal). I'm very good at my job, and have worked my way up to a fairy good hourly wage. 

I started working for this new employer in the fall last year. They specialize in HVAC ducting with an insanely quick turnaround time, and when I applied with my previous experience they were excited to have me.

For background, I have a medical condition that requires weekly appointments and followups. I got into a treatment program I fought for months to get into and it has been a lifesaver for me. I was 100% up front about this with my new employer, stating that I absolutely \*needed\* Fridays off for medical appointments, but they could run me ragged through the week as long as I got that day off consistently. I provided documentation from my doctor backing this up. They agreed, and I worked an evening shift starting Sunday and ending Thursday morning, anywhere from 50-55 hours a week.

This worked fine for a few months until the company started an expansion in its business and started taking on way more than they were able to comfortably accommodate. They were hiring people for my shift left and right, but could never seem to retain anyone after two months or so because the work/life balance was non-existent. I remember one welder, a good hard worker, coming up to me as he was quitting because in his words ""I've seen my kids a total of fifteen minutes in the last two weeks."" At the six month mark of my tenure there, I was the most senior employee on my shift except the supervisor. The turnover rate was so high I barely put in the effort to learn someone's name before they were gone.

Throughout all this expansion, they never hired another laser operator. The machine was essentially running 24/7 between myself and two other people, and it was the most important machine in our workflow because nothing else got done unless those parts were cut out.

At the beginning of the year, they wanted to move me to a traditional Monday-Friday shift, 7am to 7pm. I refused because I wouldn't be able to continue with my medical program, nor get anything else done during the week.

Around the middle of spring, they got backed up because one of the machines went down. I was asked if I could make an exception to my day off and come in on Friday, pretty pretty please, and me being an idiot, I agreed to it and cancelled my appointment that week, thinking it would be a one-off because the machine was only down for a day, and hey, shit happens.

Once I made an exception the first time, you can see where this is going. A few weeks later they asked me to do it again - not because the machine went down, but because they had just overextended themselves on a really expensive contract with a \*very\* big company. I objected, stating my medical exemption, and they pulled someone else in to work the shift. This happened a few times, and I did end up rearranging a few appointments because, again, I was an idiot.

Things came to a head at the end of spring. The shift as a whole had a meeting that week and decided they wanted to put it to a vote to take Sunday off and work on Friday instead. I was outvoted, wanting to work the original shift, and it was suddenly decided that everyone would be coming in Friday. The next day (a Monday) I go in and talk to HR and make them aware that this is a recurring issue; the HR manager says he'll handle it and get back to me the next day.

I talk to my doctor and let him know there's a chance I'll need to reschedule again; I get a phone call from the medical office stating that I've ended up rescheduling or cancelling a lot in the past few months and if it kept happening, I was at risk of getting dropped from the program. I cannot and will not allow that to happen.

I go in the next day and talk to HR, letting them know that I was promised this wasn't going to be an issue. I reminded them they agreed to my scheduling and I had provided them documentation that I could not work on Fridays. HR calls in my supervisor.

For context, my supervisor was one of those people who don't really see value in anything but work. He got married last year, and he took no time off for his wedding - he worked a full shift on Friday, got married Saturday, and was back at work on Sunday morning. He expects everyone underneath him to adhere to this insanity disguised as work ethic and is one of the reasons our turnover was so high.

What follows is a heated argument about how he needs me to work that shift and he won't even try to call in someone else. I tell them I'll come in on Saturday; that won't work. I tell them I'll do four 14 hour shifts that week to make up the production, as this company has absolutely no qualms with handing out overtime to anyone who wants it. That won't work either.

Supervisor stands firm, HR looks at me and shrugs, telling me there's nothing he can do. I'm pissed at this point and go to work my shift, updating my resume and seeing what other jobs are available in my field, and there's a \*lot.\*

The plan was to get a new job and turn in notice, but then the supervisor comes up to me and tries to be buddy buddy. He starts a long winded yarn about how sometimes we have to sacrifice for work, and that there are things expected of us as adults in a functioning society, and then tells me ""You need to make a decision.""

I have heard that phrase a handful of times in my life, and nobody who ever says it to me does so out of concern - it's always a ""you need to decide to do what I'm telling you to do of your own free will.""

I grunt and say ""Yeah, I guess I do.""

Asshole then slaps me on the back, smiles, and says ""Great! See you Friday.""

That was the breaking point for me. I did work the rest of my shift, but at the end of the night I drafted up a resignation letter effective immediately, left it on HR's desk, and walked out. Went home, put my phone on silent, and slept like the dead. I'm almost 40 and that's the first time in my life I've ever quit a job on the spot.

I had four missed calls from my company the next morning - two from HR, one from the boss of the company, and one from my now ex-supervisor. Never returned them.

I did end up getting a new job at a company that respects my hours and has a much better work/life balance, and a raise in my salary to boot. Six weeks had gone by, and I stopped in at the gas station that all of us would go to on break to grab a drink. I ran into one of the only coworkers that I liked, and he told me what happened.

When I quit, they didn't have anyone else on my shift who knew how to run and operate the machine. They started leaning on the other two people, causing one of \*them\* to quit, and on top of that half a dozen welders and other fabricators quit as well in a domino effect. The entire production completely backed up because of this, and that big client that I mentioned earlier? They're named after a particular rainforest in South America and were building a bunch of new distribution centers in the area - our company landed the contract to do their HVAC work on several, with a possibility of extending it outward to more depending on how the initial partnership went...and it went poorly. They missed the target date for the production run and the penalties for doing so ate up any profit they were going to get from the job that they underbid, along with causing Rainforest Company to cancel the contract after the initial work. Nobody got bonuses that quarter...causing even more people to quit.

Now, when I look at their company page on Indeed, they're desperately looking for people but the salary ranges are down about 20% from when I applied when things were good.

All I wanted was for them to honor the one day off I needed and they agreed to."

I've already put my notice in, so this won't be a problem much longer. I work for a small business and the owner is a former coworker of my partner, who also knows my boss's family.

Two paychecks ago, my check bounced/was clawed back. I had cashed it at my bank and it was bounced the next day,  despite clearing the day I cashed it. Get that problem solved but I'm on alert. 

Last paycheck was a day late and boss waited till a little while before 5 to let us all know it's ready, then asked the main crew to wait about 30 more min to cash it (basically wait till after business hours) before hurrying out of there. He didn't ask every employee, just the ones that do the hard labor. 

Today, as I'm cashing what looks to be my last check, I find out my last paycheck had the same thing happen ELEVEN DAYS AFTER I CASHED IT. Bank doesn't call (separate issue but wtf??? They let my account sit in the negative and just plan on sending me a letter??) so now the check I just deposited I can't even spend because it was just enough to cover the last one. Call the boss up to tell him and he acts soooo surprised, has to ""talk to his bookkeeper"" and will ""get to the bottom of it asap."" At this point, I'm thinking I'll be lucky to have my money on Monday. 

There's no way he just doesn't know right? Like, if his bank is waiting *eleven days* to claw it back he had to have had some notification.  Also, there's no way just my check was bounced/clawed back, whatever. I feel like I'm being scammed and that I'm going to have to go through this a third time with today's check.

Fired, with very little savings, living alone and paying rent.

That membership has now elected a party leader they can trust to deliver the unfettered Brexit they’ve always wanted, turning Britain into the often mentioned “Singapore-on-Thames”, an Ayn Rand-inspired free market haven, where international capital can operate unhindered by regulations that protect the public interest.

Truss is surely one of the world’s last remaining open advocates of trickle-down economics – the idea that if you cut taxes for the rich, you will spur growth, and the benefits will be felt by everyone. It’s a [ludicrous idea](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/12/16/bb-notrickle-down-tax-cuts-for-rich-fuel-inequality-study-finds) that, when practised, has allowed the richest to capture nearly all the gains of economic growth, creating a hollowed-out economy which exists as little more than a cash machine for the global elite, atop a society so unequal it’s coming apart at the seams. Even United States President [Joe Biden has said](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/9/summit-of-americas-biden-promises-economic-help-ambitious-actions) that he is “sick and tired of trickle-down economics.

Someone leaves early for a doc appt? The whole office knows about it. You take too long in the bathroom? The whole office knows about it. 

 To top it off, one of the women is incredibly racist, yelling about Juneteenth and how she doesn’t “understand” why we got a day off for it, and making fun of Indian clients because they wore turbans.  

My coworkers and I are planning to definitely shut down the racism with HR this coming week, but I am at the point where I want to get an accommodation to work from home. Being in the office at this point just seems pointless and more toxic than quietly getting my work done at home.

It's an epidemic and is truly horrible.

I've encountered two of these schlubs in my last two jobs, working as a line cook and at a hotel. 

At the restaurant, the ""kitchen manager"" was too lazy to go open the restaurant and would just sit at home looking at the cameras to see if employees came in.  He would also just look at the video from the parking lot and when people started showing up, he'd arrive about 2 hours later in the middle of the rush. One day, during a heat wave, and his mom was out of town (she would actually go to the premises to unlock the doors and turn on the A/C...lol) This jackass left us working with no A/C in 110 degree temps and was just watching his camera. I texted him that I wouldn't work in these conditions and I left. He showed up and then turned the A/C on, and said it was broken but the repair guys just fixed it, which is a blatant lie. He was just too lazy to go to the actual premises to open the restaurant. 

I quit that bullshit the same day and went to work at a hotel. It's a 24/7 hotel with a restaurant. The GM left every day at 3PM and then the whole other two shifts were completely unmanaged. Instead of hiring a manager for the other shifts, this guy would just call the front desk relentlessly and try to manage over the phone. He'd check the cameras from his office the next day and spend hours just watching the shift to see what happened from the day before.

  
Like..... WTF why would you manage your business by watching a camera the next day? It's so ridiculous. These people are the laziest most inept people and somehow they get promoted to management. A minimum wage worker who shows up to every shift on time has 10x the work ethic of these shit managers. Yet, an actual worker will be stuck at minimum no matter how hard they work.

Under this system, shit literally somehow floats to the top, and you have good for nothing ""remote managers"" trying to manage the actual people that work.

If you encounter any workplace with an unreasonable amount of cameras everywhere and a NSA style multi-monitor setup to watch your moves, just know... They are fat lazy dumbasses that can't manage their own place. They will delegate their own management tasks to you, with no additional pay. STAY AWAY!"

They *all* say that.  If I'm on a W2 I can just ask my agency for a raise and they'll almost always provide it so long as I'm delivering.

Only directors and C levels are able to receive a 4 or 5 I'm told.

Anyway I'm currently a W2 at a decent gig that eventually will be full time if I push for it, and I'm curious what sorts of responses I can have for that loaded bullshit line I've been fed my entire professional life, because I've pissed gold just to test it, and got a 3. Tried malicious compliance, got a 3. Pissed away full weeks on doing nothing, 3. Saw folks get a 2 because they were late or had a myriad of health maladies, but man I want to backhand the smug idiot who made this normal. 

I know it's not the direct report's fault--they can't get higher than a 3 either--but them psychologically prepping me to accept it as a typical corporate standard is just as bad as being an active participant. It's clear they have been taught to tell their employees this and 100% believe it. Who makes the call and spreads the word to management that allows this as the norm?  

What's with the bullshit system if only a fraction of old useless suits are eligible for the bigger numbers determining a rate increase on top of their even bigger bonus than everyone else?  This is why I try to remain a contractor when possible, the company has to pay a shit ton more for me to remain there and I can work on other things at the same time like masturbating, making webtoons, and playing with my cats.

I work at a food place, and at the interview i was told id be contracted 8 hours (they didnt say anything about extra shifts). On my contract it says that its 8 hours, but there may be times where i may have to do additional work so i thought fair enough. Then when i finally start work, i keep getting 16 hours or more in shifts (not really complaining since its more money). I recently got offered a part time retail job so i took it as ive always wanted to be in retail, so once i signed that contract i told my manager that i cant work from 6am-2pm on 3 days but that id still be available for other hours. Then he tells me that they want full time people, and that during my interview i said i was available on all days. 1) not once did they tell me that they were looking for people that would work full time hours, i was told it was part time and a part time contract. 2)I told him that at the interview because at that time it was true?? 
He is offering me full time hours now, but im definitely going to take the retail job. I just dont understand, its only 3 days of the week and id still be available for the busy evening hours on the same days that i would work at the retail job. 

Thanks for reading my little rant :)"

Finding a decent job is completely suicide inducing now yet my family will talk crap and call me lazy, despite almost all of them being way fatter and lazier than me. It baffles me how blind older generations are that we're nothing more than pawns to make the top 1% richer and richer and richer while they hoarde the profits made off our labor to themselves. It infuriates me because I know damn well we all outnumber these greedy pieces of shit and have every ounce of power to fight back and say ""NO MORE"" to the low wages and horrible workplace toxicity. But no. Older generations will always be at the younger generations throats. Gaslighting them for being lazy while simultaneously wasting their lives in front of a fucking television screen. Is it so wrong to just want to make enough to move away from my braindead ass family for good?

54,2024-07-06,My boss completely ghosted me after a moral harassment report. He and the harasser did what they could to fire me but a director took my side. Now I'm looking another job and I'm afraid I'll disappoint her,u/OkAd5094,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dwraki/my_boss_completely_ghosted_me_after_a_moral/,antiwork,"
TLDR: I encouraged a victim of moral harassment to report it to compliance and HR, and I was a witness. After that, she was fired and since then my Boss and his manager (the harasser) ghosted me completely. They did what they could to fire me but another director took my side and kept me in Company. Now, I'm almost getting a new job and I feel like I'm betraying this director, who helped me and need my work.

First of all, I apology for possible bad English, it isn't my mother tongue.

I work on a Big4 firm, and I guess this probably gives you an idea of work culture and the profile of people. 

So basically, I had a colleague a few months ago that reported a moral harassment to compliance and HR against one of our managers. Let's name this colleague Brenda and the manager Lucy. The department's director is George and he is my line manager (I didn't report to Lucy)

Lucy had several behavioural problems and Brenda isn't the first person to complain about her leadership. In fact, before her, 2 other colleagues changed team and/or management because of Lucy's behavior. Brenda was just the first one to come forward to make a formal report. I'm not going into details of the content, however It involved very deep micro-managing (to the point of humilation and invasion of privacy), psychological gaslighting and threats of dismissing. 

I asked Brenda If she would prefer to keep reporting to me while Compliance took providence, which she *and my Boss* agreed. George said that Lucy's behavior was indeed unacceptable and she would receive feedback on that. 

Brenda was fired 2 weeks after reporting. We where completely shocked because not only they didn't give any formal feedback to her, but because It is against the rules to fire someone after a reporting like that, It is a retaliation.

HR and compliance made an interview with me and another colleague, let's name this one James, to investigate the report. James is one of the people that asked to our director to be out of Lucy's management, Otherside he would rather leave Company. James was very honest with HR. 

When HR talked to me about Lucy, I was also honest and explained the team general situation was bad and I was unsatisfied with How George conducted the situation and how disonest he was. 

So... Since that, George and Lucy have been weird with James and I. They kept information from us, declined meetings, stopped talking to us and became super cold. 

This week, James was fired. George justified his dismissal as ""performance problems"". HR had a Meeting with me and told me there was an opportunity in another team and asked If I was interested. I said yes, because I had internal information that I was going to be fired too, so kinda had no choice.

The director of the other team, let's name her Alice,  IS a very ethical person. I already work with her on a daily básica and I know she likes my job. I had a Meeting with her and she explained that George insisted on HR to fire me for at least 1 month. HR didn't want to because I have good feedback from partners and managers and my performance rates do not comply with what George was allegating. 

Alice told me she fought to keep me as her team would benefit from my skills. I appreciated her. 

George didn't talk to me for weeks. He excluded me from team meetings before my actual ""dismissal"". He already hired someone to replace me. He and Lucy excluded me completely and he didn't spoke a word with me, regarding anything. It's literally as If I disappeared. 

However, since the problem with Brenda (around 2 months ago) I've been searching for other jobs. I'm extremely tired, feel betrayed and gaslighted. I am currently expecting a final feedback from a company (not competitor, industry) but I feel so grateful to Alice and I know she took a risk. I'm afraid I'll be disappointing the only person that stood for me in this sea of crap.

I ignored both messages. ,u/Double_Interview2305,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dws2ym/a_supervisor_texted_and_called_me_on_pto_the/,antiwork,"I work at a well-known retail chain pharmacy. I’ve been here since last August. Anyway, I had never taken PTO since I’ve been here until as of recent. I was on PTO from July 3-5. I wasn’t scheduled to work today, July 6 anyway. It wasn’t much because I didn’t have enough hours to begin with, but it was still good enough for me to not think about the challenges I face at work. Anyway, I got a text on the 4th of July and then thirty minutes later a call from work. This was from the same pharmacist. 

She just recently came back from personal matters and hasn’t been here since April. I acknowledge and understood that nobody probably told her I was on PTO to begin with. The pharmacy manager has been on PTO for a little over a week. But if she did know that I was on PTO, however, why would she contact me? Apparently a coworker who got hired with me at the same time last August called off last second for his shift today. Given that I live the closest to the pharmacy, and am bilingual in English and Spanish, they needed coverage. I felt bad at first for ignoring the messages, but I remembered something. 

I had worked essentially almost 40 hours per week since I first began last August. It wasn’t until the end of June that my hours were suddenly cut without warning to 25-29 hours per week. I’m not a certified pharmacy technician, just a pharmacy technician in training. I worked so hard for them, only to screw me over. When another location of the pharmacy I worked at closed, the pharmacy manager accepted a certified pharmacy technician. I get it, he needed help to assist the other two pharmacy technicians while I worked with my other responsibilities. I still can’t fathom how he was willing to cut my hours without warning and give the new pharmacy tech almost 40 hours per week. I’m the only employee whose hours were cut this drastically. 

That is why when I got the text message and call to cover a shift today, I knew I had to stand up for myself to them for once in my life. I thought they didn’t need my assistance as much anymore? I know I could’ve gone to work today. I wanted to send everyone a clear message that because I was screwed over, I’m going to return the favor by not going into work when I well could have done so. Am I being stubborn? I don’t think so. Any comments/advice are appreciated. 

I continue to look for jobs so I can leave my current position. I know that with my college degrees, I will succeed in the end sooner than later.

I am pretty smart (not gonna lie) and got a semi scholarship at a good college in a first world country. I still have to pay for somethings and it isn't cheap.

I also have MA so doctor's bills and maintenance takes a lot. The only good thing about me is that I'm a pretty girl which gets me pretty privilege.

Anyway my manager/boss has been disrespectful from the start. He is the same ethnicity as mine so it isn't racism. He is super rich and can afford to pay me more but doesn't.

When I make even one mistake or reschedule, he goes off on me. So everytime I do something, he tells me ""oh god why do you do this"".

Last year, I left a very long career because of bs management plans.  I was moved from a department that I worked in for 15 years to a shitty one so I left as soon as I got the opportunity.

My husband has a decent job so I have the flexibility to quit without notice.

I have not connected with a single person in the place so I do not care about a reference.  I also have a pretty solid work history and with people who'd give glowing references so I won't put it on my resume.  I'll figure out how to explain the gap later. 

I'll gather my things (not too much, thankfully) and I'll give my supervisor my letter of resignation on my next workday.  If I am asked why, I will simply state something along the lines of, ""This job & your management style is affecting my health.""

i applied to a lot of kitchen jobs and got a call from this woman who seemed to be very nice, but sort of insisted im not in the kitchen (sort of expected since im a girl, annoying though because i love working in kitchens) and eventually hired me after an interview. the restaurant wasn’t open yet so i decided id try to come in and help so i could become well versed in the business and hopefully get more hours because of the head start i had. she told me she’d be opening in the next few days. that moved back to a week, and now it’s been quite a while since i interviewed with her and she keeps pushing the opening date back, to a point where i could’ve gone to lebanon to see my family who i haven’t seen since 2018 but i skipped the holiday since i thought id be working. 

it’s now at a point where she expects free labour, and begins harassing me with texts and calls if i don’t come in for a couple days and spend hours doing random jobs that don’t contribute anything to me actually working in the restaurant. 

my boyfriend arrived a couple days ago and i’ve been wanting to spend time with him, so obviously i haven’t gone in unpaid. she’s become agitated, and since she offered my boyfriend a job too (she acted like it was a favour to me but i knew it was because another male coworker quit) she’s began holding our jobs over our heads. like messaging me since my bf and i haven’t come in “i guess he doesn’t want a job” and calling me while im out doing things. i’m really angry i wasn’t able to visit my family and i feel i can’t quit because i don’t know if i can find another job. when i have decent french i can stand up more since i would never usually let a boss do this to me.

I would like your opinion on my company's wages and benefits, even though I'm going to get downvotes because I'm a greedy capitalist."

Nor did he pay for time and a half .. or treat anyone to a cookout.. no instead he treated us like we were in middle school.. chips and a fucking sloppy joe. Like wtf? 

I'm edging closer to just returning back to my family overseas.. the american dream is the dream to treat the lower class like dogwater.

I applied to work there over a year and a half ago while the interior was still being built. (Side note, this is in a multi-business building. The place was already there, just not the restaurant). I got an interview, guy was fairly friendly, and after about 10-15 mins, I felt fairly confident. Later found out I wasn't accepted, which at the time, I didn't think anything of it

Fast forward to yesterday. They have a hiring sign on their window, and I thought I'd pop in an ask. The conversation lasted less than 5 mins, and they said that the only position they had was servers, and they wanted 1 years experience to qualify. That hiring sign has been up since the place opened, and yet they still only want people with experience? To serve tables? I'd understand if it was something like security or cooks or management, but not serving customers. Perhaps there's something I don't know about, but not wanting to pay for training when you've been looking for employees for over a year, you'd think you'd rralize there's an issue, but apparently not

I will give the manager credit, he was very polite, explained things clearly, and seemed like an overall chill dude. But not willing to offer training for a position you're failing to fill... Yeah, no, that ain't right"
0,2024-07-06,Racist Boss fired me for asking for money i was owed.,u/IKROWNI,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dwxd8s/racist_boss_fired_me_for_asking_for_money_i_was/,antiwork,"I started working for a hemp store about 2 years ago and instantly fell in love with my job. Customers would come in and tell me their problems and i would find products that legitimately helped them from THC edibles to help with sleep to CBD dog treats that helped their dogs get through fireworks or staved off seizures like my dog. I absolutely loved this job. The only problem with it was my boss. About 3 months intot he job we were getting a new POS system installed by a company and me and the guy installing it were chatting it up. My boss walks intot he store and while were having a discussion about rent prices being too high i was telling him my daughter was living with me again because of the high rent. My boss looks me in the eye and says ""she can rent one of my trailers as long as she wont have any black people in it"". Me and the installer guy both looked at each other like wtf?

I was hired as a retail associate and my job duties included tending to customers and keeping the front end shelves stocked up. That was basically it and maybe some light cleaning at the end of the day.

From this point my boss found out i had other skills he could use such as being able to fix his laptop, the POS, 3d art stuff, and building a website. He started asking me to perform more duties such as fixing his website, creating social media accounts to promote the business, SEO to make his business show up higher on search engines, creating 3d animations to play on the TVs int he store, creating flyers for his events, business cards with a logo for his business, etc.

When he asked me to perform all of these duties i asked him for a raise and he said he couldn't accommodate a raise at the time but then he offered to give me all of his tips daily and i agreed.

This went on for about a year before he decided he wanted to start another store in the next city over. He hired 2 female workers there and the store wasnt doing to great. He came into my store one day complaining that both of the workers there quit on him at the same time because he was late for the 3rd time paying them their checks. He posted a now hiring sign at the front of my store and gave me a stack of applications to hand out to those interested. A guy came in that seemed very knowledgable about the products and seemed a perfect fit for our store so i gave him an application. The guy handed it in to my boss the next day. After that i came in for my shift to relieve my boss. He said ""oh yeah a guy came in and dropped off an application. Don't waste my printer paper and ink handing out applications to N@#$@RS"". This blew my mind that he said this so i started trying to audio record him saying that again but i never did capture it.

Couple months later he said he wanted to work fewer hours at the main store and told me he was hiring his cousin to work with me. His cousin started working with us and since im the one that handled the POS and backend stuff i noticed he wasnt on payroll and his name wasnt in our system but someone was clocking in under a different name. I asked him what that was about and he said its because his cousin is on social security disability and it would lower or possibly get rid of his SS check if he claims the money he makes there so he was paying him off the books. 

He came to me one day and asked me if i knew how to handle a product launch and that he wanted to have his own brand of product in the store and i told him that i could handle it so he asked me if id like to go 50/50 with him on a business venture. He said he wanted me to start a separate business so that i could be selling the products to him so everything would be legit and legal. So i formed my own LLC called ""The Hemperium"". He said we both needed to invest $1500 for product. I told him i didn't have that kind of money lying around to toss at it but i would slowly pay towards it as we get the product launched. At first he wanted to do dabs because they had the highest markup. So i ordered 320 dab containers and lids. About a week went by and he calls me to tell me that he changed his mind and that we would do flower starting off instead. So i ordered 300 flower jars and lids with heat seal foil liners. I created labels for the jars and did all of the research into how the jars had to be labeled in order to meet federal guidelines. I told him i had a supplier that would get us the flower at 32% THCa and sell to us at $800/lb. But instead of listening to me he ordered 2lbs of 28% THCa at $1200/lb. So that wiped out $2400 of the funds. I had only paid in $1000 of the investment by this time but i also ordered labels, and other stuff needed for the venture on the side that totaled up to about $400. So all in at this point i had invested about $1400. When the flower came in he told me he didn't want me weighing and packaging everything at his store cause he was worried about getting raided so he asked me to do it from my home. I said sure because i really didn't see the danger he did. I took all of the stuff to my house and started weighing, packaging, labeling, sealing, and pricing all of the jars. 256 jars of flower we planned to sell at $29.99/3.5gram jar. They flew off of the shelves and were all sold within a week. It took me about a week to handle all of it.

One day i noticed that his cousin hadn't clocked out so i looked in the backend and saw that he had been clocked in for 382 hours. So then i started thinking about it and was like ""well if hes clocked in during my shifts and i'm getting tips then how is that being handled"". Started poking around more and noticed the guy was ciphering off half of my tips. So i went through all the days i had worked and counting all the tips i should have had and realized i was short by almost $500. I created a spreadsheet for my boss to show him what had happened and left it on his computer for him to see the next day when he came in. When it was time for my shift to relieve him i asked him if he had seen the spreadsheet and he said he did and that i was wrong because after he looked into it he said he over paid me in tips by $90 and was asking for it back. I told him he was wrong and that i could show him that he was wrong. He didn't want to hear it so i asked him when i could get paid from the flower jars. He told me that he never agreed to 50/50 and that his other business closing has hurt him financially and that he could no longer give me $15/jar and that he ""thought"" that $3-$4 seemed more appropriate. I looked at him in utter disbelief and when i did that he said ""if you don't like it there's the door"" so i walked out that day. I wrote him an email telling him i wanted him to cease using any of my artwork for his company and that i expected my half of the sales on the jars and the $500 for my tips or i would be contacting an attorney. He went on a rant about how i should know better than to threaten him and that he would have my ass if i ever threatened him again. He said that because i used his printer to print the labels and used his entire ink cartridge and because i had only given him $1000 that i hadn't fulfilled my end of the deal therefore i wasn't entitled to half. He told me not to text him again and that i would get a check in the mail for the jars. A week later i receive the check and its for $860.

Since this has happened i contacted the social security AIG i think its called an filled out a whistleblower complaint, i sent a complaint to the federal department of labor and my states department of labor. I contacted about 30 lawyers and they all want a $400 consult fee that i cant afford. I tried contacting the EEOC but their website tells me they only handle businesses with 15 or more employees. I contacted the south carolina legal help line and filled out their application but never heard back from them. Now i am pretty much stuck at this point and haven't heard back from a single one of these agencies.

I just wanted to rant about how terrible my boss really was hes a true piece of shit of a person. Even knowingly selling massive amounts of kratom to a girl that ended up dying from his products. It feels like the guy is untouchable just because he has more money than me. I guess this is just the way the system was designed to work though."

5,2024-07-06,Questions about Sick Leave and Holiday Policies,u/SteinsDomain,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dwy58x/questions_about_sick_leave_and_holiday_policies/,antiwork,"I've been working at this small company for about a year (just about 15 employees)and up until now, things have been very laid back when it comes to scheduling and time off and stuff like that.

For example, when I first started, I explained to the boss some hmof my home life situation when figuring out what days could be worked.i have a special needs brother at home, as well as other responsibilities that unfortunately sometimes have to come before work (I can't very well leave a child with DS home alone if our babysitter cancels) and he's usually been pretty understanding about when I need to call out. 

This goes for everyone working there. We all desperately need the job for one reason or another, and we all love working there, but many of us have outside issues (medical, family, living arrangement issues, etc) that we've all had to miss days for here and there. When he told us that he wants us to consider holidays (like this past fourth of july) to be regular work days, and that he would not pay overtime for it, and also told us that it was still a mandatory work day, we all just kinda complied because we all need the job too badly to say no.

Today, he messages us all in the discord chat he's going to implement the nys attendance policy, with sick leave that accrued and all that. Personally I think it's a great idea, but then he followed it with:

""I've been applying sick time to many of you when you needed to call out"" 

He never told any of us this before hand so now many of us are dealing with this new policy and have like 3 hours worth of ""sick leave"" each because he apparently was keeping track of it this whole time without telling us.

On top of that, as far as I can tell from talking to my fellow employees, no one's ever been paid a sick day when they didn't show up. It's always just been ""No show, no money"" which makes sense.

A lot of us are concerned because he's pulling this out of nowhere, yet there seem to be a bunch of other policies he *should* follow, but chooses not to, while suddenly springing this new sick leave policy out of nowhere. I don't know what to do or what's legal, and I could use some advice. 

Almost all of us are in a group chat without the boss, and trying to figure out how to bring up our concerns problems with how he's been treating us lately. We're all kind of scared and a bit hurt, because we all put so much into his business. 

For example, when I first started working, I had no car, so was riding in with a coworker. Things changed and I couldn't get the ride anymore, so I spent almost $70 a day to Uber back and forth from work. Due to the nature of waiting for users, I had a few latenesses, and he basically told me I wouldn't have a job if I couldn't make it consistently. With the no money I had, all I could do was buy a crappy beater car that needed a ton of work, when I really wanted to try and save for just a few months till I could get something more reliable. But I *needed* the car, so I panic bought whatever I could find and afford.

 Every 2-3 months something breaks down. This week it was my Intake Manifold Gasket. I couldn't even pat for ubers, so I had to call out two days, and then picked up two shifts later in the week to make up for it.

At the end of one of those makeup shifts, he pulls me aside and starts telling me that if I can't be consistent, he's going o have to cut my hours or worse, even though he KNOWS I was driving that car for 3 days to get to work while leaking antifreeze before the car finally couldn't take it anymore and I needed to bring it to a mechanic.

Thus is a lot, I know, we just don't know what to do, we're getting different answers on what the laws and policies actually are by NYS standards, and we feel like we're being used with no way to bring it up to him and solve it."

Last Friday I spoke on teams with an upper office manager, and been told I've been moved location demoted, and been given a pay cut... I was not allowed to really say anything, this is just how it is.. I emailed my side and response, but I doubt it was read.

So I walked into the office Wednesday unannounced and asked to speak to HR, we spoke for about an hour, where I laid it all out, and she just had that look where you could tell she didn't like what she was hearing... and she would pass it forward to the regional manager, my bosses bosses boss... She called the next day to get some information clarification for her email, and I requested an in person meeting with regional, i requested in email and on that call, this is happening next week...

I have yet to inform them that I have also had a meeting with an employment lawyer, and they are ready to go, they are calling it creative dismissal, they have no cause to fire me and are just doing what they are in hopes I quit.. from how it looks, they have filled my position and just have no actual spot for me now.

And I got the other job as well, had my orientation Thursday, and probably start next week.... going into this meeting with a loaded deck and not a thing to lose.... So this turned out pretty good so far,  "

15,2024-07-06,I got fired because sending an email to my team about people not proof-reading makes me a bully to my boss's bestie,u/WeStanPlankton,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dx0rqz/i_got_fired_because_sending_an_email_to_my_team/,antiwork,"I don't even know here to begin, but I've made numerous posts about this job, but I got fired a few weeks ago.

Basically, my boss gave me a raise and told me I was bright and doing so great, but that I need to be more assertive and more ""brilliant."" Well, I tried that and sent out a mass email to my team, we are demand writers at a law firm, that was like ""hey, I review all of our demand letters because I make all the presentations for mediation no top of my own load of demand letters, and I am catching a lot of errors. please keep in mind, if I see errors, that means the letter has been sent out to opposing counsel already, sometimes multiple times."" Admittedly the letter had a more confrontational tone because this has been an ongoing issue.

Here's backstory:

I have been in trouble for sending out letters with errors in the past. I actually got written up because of an absolutely insane manager named K believes that since I have a bachelor's degree in English, my first drafts should be perfect and that proof-reading is for weak writers ""if they need it."" (there is so much more about this person but that is a whole other tirade) I suspect that write up may not have been valid because despite our boss's signature on it, our boss had no idea that I was written up somehow. Also, K refused to give me a copy of the write up and I had to get another manager to give it to me.

K is a special case. K was an assistant principle in Washington D.C. (though she constantly changes it to principal but some of us did a search and she was assistant principal), who eventually moved to Texas and left for ""moral reasons"" and took up an entry level position as a demand writer at a law firm. K has tormented the entire office with her insane beliefs. She does everything she can to prove to everyone how ""strong"" she is, but it's just flat out bullying. She constantly starts drama, minimizes everything everyone does, constantly reminds everyone how busy she always is despite never actually doing anything or pushing her work onto new hires. I've never met anyone who does this, but it is impossible to talk to her because she will look you in the face and simply not understand a word you are saying. Or she will repeat it back to you, but it's extremely oversimplified and warped and you sound like a terrible person even if it was just like something ordinary. She got moved out of our office because she was constantly harassing me. Then she got promoted to paralegal, but then got demoted about a month later for bullying people and because she made a phone call on speaker to her husband and started talking about how mentally ill and incompetent I am in front of a bunch of coworkers. From there, our boss, who would normally fire someone on the spot for half of the things she does, moved her to literally every single office in the firm because she would start problems. She was completely forbidden to speak to me because she started calling ""meetings"" that ended up being traps where she would try to intimidate me and make it sound like our boss was making her tell me that I'm in trouble for this or that and try to upset me. Sometimes she would call meetings and never show as well.

She moved on and set her sights on our new manager and the office manager, befriended one of the other writers, J, who started causing problems with everyone because she would report everything she saw to K, who would text it to our boss. K and J refuse to let anyone proof-read their work and even started locking documents in the files we use. Then would send them out after not being reviewed at all. Our new manager tried to address it, but apparently K started sending email after email after email to every attorney and paralegal, terrorizing them about the new manager because she is 26 and K has a double masters and she is so busy and the backbone of this office and blah blah blah. Our boss told the new manager that she can't tell K what to do, and if anyone has a problem with K, tell her and she'll deal with it personally. Well, that turned into our boss screaming at anyone who has a complaint about K. Boss's logic is that if so many people are complaining about the same person, then everyone is clearly just bullying that person and she ""stands up for the underdog.""

Cue the mass exodus. Turnover rate went through the roof, and it was already extremely high. Everyone our boss didn't fire immediately for every little thing quit because K and J cause constant issues with everyone. Meanwhile, our boss stopped giving out bonuses and started doing some really weird stuff with our benefits (I still don't fully understand what exactly). She started screaming at everyone to set mediations every single day until we start making more money. Guess what? There weren't enough cases ready for mediation and she started accepting every single case that went through the door, every single day. Overtime was always approved, and that was great until it was literally impossible to keep up.

We get a little reprieve a few months ago because my boss went on a long vacation. K got so much worse because our boss wanted her to report everything that happened while she was away. We had a bunch of new hires, our new manager had an emergency and left when they first got here, so K took it upon herself to train them even after manger got back. The new hires then had to be retrained by me and the new manager because K's way was completely wrong. Almost all of them quit, and the rest quit because K stopped training them and started forcing them to do her work so K could start redecorating the office, which no one wanted her to do, not even our boss.

Meanwhile, J stood over my shoulder, constantly asking what my progress was, constantly getting on me for being on my phone (I was on my phone, but she wasn't my boss or my manager, and I did way more work than her and got it done quickly). She constantly got in trouble for doing the same to everyone around her because she didn't think anyone was working hard enough. (she and K are literally  entry level demand writers at this point and nothing else.)

Everyone let K and J carry on because the barrage of complaints from writers to clerks to paralegals to attorneys to managers about them had us convinced our boss would do something. Nope. She removed all HR duties from all managers (firm isn't big enough to have a designated HR department, but the office manager, business operations manager, and manager of the demand writers were effectively HR). So everyone goes to her in person, and she goes berserk on everyone because we're all just bullies to her friend. that's her friend and we're just being so mean to her for no reason.

Back to my email:

J goes off on me, says there have been meetings about my behavior. That I am unstable and that I traipse around the office being extremely offensive, and I'm addicted to my phone, and I'm in serious trouble and how dare I accuse them of sending out flawed work. I tell her she isn't my manager, and she recoils like I hit her. Then my boss calls me (she was running late that day) and cusses me out and tells me im so condescending and arrogant, and that I clearly want to be fired. That I'm such an offensive person and everyone is afraid of me. I ended up yelling back at my boss, but I was insisting that I have always said we need a firm proof reading system or we are going to continue having this problem. Maybe I shouldn't have yelled, but she was cursing and screaming at me. She also constantly yells in the office that no one is honest with her, no one will sit her down and scream at her and drill the truth into her head. Then she started saying I was just being mean to K like everyone else, but I didn't even bring her up nor did I address her specifically in my email. I made sure my email was addressing everyone, including myself.

I get off work that day, and they called me and said I'm fired and I will be locked out of the building because they are afraid of me because I yelled back. I get there, and they literally set my stuff by the back door and had one of the men in the office slide it through the door at me. I didn't even say anything mean when I yelled though, it was literally about proof-reading and my boss hung up on me.

I heard through the grapevine that the firm is in dire straits financially, so I wonder if that is part of the most recent mess.

I recently started working at a new craft cocktail bar. Generally speaking, the owner (who is also the manager) is great, and I really get along with him! Today however I noticed something troubling: when I was reviewing my time punches for the week I noticed that I had been clocked out for a 30 minute unpaid break yesterday and the day before, even though I didn’t take a break.

I decided to check out the employee handbook and found this:

“All employees working more than six (6) hours per shift will be required to take a thirty (30) minute unpaid “meal” break AND up to two (2) fifteen (15) minute paid breaks during the day.”

It also states, “the scheduling of all breaks may be established by an employee’s supervisor.” Well, he never told me to go on break, so I never took one! 

It is slightly more complicated (I think) by the fact that I am a smoker. I do periodically step out and take smoke breaks and the handbook says “smoke or cigarette breaks shall be considered as break time.”

I feel like this is wage theft, but I don’t want to bring it up if he’s going to be able to throw my smoke breaks in my face as an excuse to clock me out. Any guidance?"

i have 2 years of entry level (sales associate) retail experience, working in fashion. i have other talents, like i love makeup and art and design. i love writing and research and books. but i have no training, experience, or certifications in anything other than retail unfortunately.
i plan on going back to college next spring to finish my art degree in interior design, but until then, i need to start making income as soon as possible.
i’ve applied to a lot of smaller more (hopefully) manageable positions in retail. like some clothing stores, book stores, gift shops. but in terms of outside that field, i have no idea what to look for. and i’m worried even the smaller jobs i’m applying for will be too much on my body.

It's just part time and online, and I know I can juggle it with my current work responsibilities. It was good pay for what it was, so I was like k cool. Did the video interview this afternoon. 

During our call, interviewer and I connected well, and she said I was her first interview of the day and that she thought I nailed it and was a great fit. She mentioned she still needed to go through with another couple of scheduled interviews for the job, but she already liked my resume and fit for the position, so she told me the pay and situation and said she'd push me through to HR and I'd receive word re next steps from them soon. 

I went on a walk and called a friend to excitedly talk about getting this offer on the spot, and I even said it was a big ego boost because I've been kinda down lately. 

I came home from my walk to an email asking if I'd mind doing a 2nd interview?!?!

I messaged back agreeably but also mentioned, ""In our meeting, did I understand correctly that our next steps would be moving forward with HR? It's fine if the situation changed, but I wanted to be clear about what phase of the process we are in.""

Anyway, she messaged back with, ""Yes, I wanted to go straight to HR because I think you'd be a great fit, but my boss Joe would like to clarify.""

I was like ???? Kinda embarassed and hurt? Like wtf? Isn't that mad unprofessional? Is that normal? Am I making myself look bad by messaging saying like whatttt did I misunderstand?!?! I feel stupid for calling my friend right away about it... feeling antiwork ish right now!!!!"
0,2024-07-06,Humans NEED work. ,u/qpooqpoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dx3688/humans_need_work/,antiwork,"I want to see here how many people in this sub agree that humans NEED work, it's just that the work must be PURPOSEFUL--directly related to the life and death circumstances of their lives--and they need to have FREEDOM in their work: they need to be able to determine how and when they do their work, and not perform it under rigid conditions handed down from above. Without PURPOSEFUL work, the inevitable result for the vast majority of people is boredom, lack of self-esteem, defeatism, purposelessness, existential angst, despair, hopelessness, etc. With purposeful work the individual experiences personal fulfillment and self-confidence. I recently read this very insightful essay on [www.wildernessfront.com](http://www.wildernessfront.com), and came across this one passage that said it best:



""But for most people it is through the power process—having a goal, making an autonomous effort, and attaining the goal—that self-es¬teem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. When one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders, etc.""

--*Industrial Society and Its Future*, Paragraph 44

  
It's clear that most people on this sub are pushing for an end to ALL work, or most work, via some technological or political means. I suspect this is because most people here have never really experienced purposeful work, and are only used to the kind of dull, monotonous, unfree, meaningless, and soul-crushing work handed down to them in technological society. In fact, most people here probably cannot even conceive of purposeful work because they have lived in an environment where it has always been completely absent. By ending ALL work, you will just be making the psychological state of the average person significantly worse: you will be INCREASING the level of boredom, purposelessness, and despair in society. Then what? The society will ""treat"" all these people to ""cure"" them of their ""problem""? This is certainly an undignified way for people to end up. People will be reduced to the status of domestic house pets. So, how many of you recognize the difference between purposeful and fulfilling work and purposeless and unfulfilling work and the fact that humans need purposeful and fulfilling work to be happy? And what is your proposed solution for this problem of lack of purposeful work in modern society today?"

like, i work a desk job 10/12 months out of the year. i’m barely able to do that, and need to sneak in a nap every day, even though all i do is work at a computer. the other two months of the year, i’m traveling for work, which will undoubtedly take SO much out of me physically. 

i love my job, but if i don’t get my health figured out, it might have to be my last year. and i don’t even want to think about what that means for the future. i’m only 23, and any plans i have for the future (grad school, my career) just have this looming cloud overhead.

I'm a fairly young guy, turning 25 soon. 6 years ago I started college while doing an ROTC program. I went to a low income high school after being homeschooled, which made most of my academic classes trivial. My lack of prep for college level work, coupled with the constant stress from the ROTC program, caused me to mentally break down and fail all my classes, and then drop out.


A year later, I finally found a job in the same town, after moving in with a friend and living there rent free for a bit. I worked for 2 years driving for Domino's. A friend got me a job working with him at a stained glass company, even though I had zero qualifications, and that was alright for about 4 years before things started going downhill. So I looked around, struggled to find anything cause the only thing that applied was my knowledge of power tools and my ability to read a tape measure, and I really want to avoid the construction industry if possible. Four years of mild construction esque activity already makes my bones and certain muscles hurt at random, I don't like the prospect of further degrading my body through hard labor.

But anyway, I was struggling to look for the next job, and so another friend decided to put a good word in at his workplace, and it was enough that I got the interview and got hired. I've been working there 7 months, but recent events have put the possibility of our entire department getting shut down on the table.


I'm just stressed because I have very little transferable work experience that can get me a job outside of construction of sole sort. I could probably find something in fast food or maybe retail eventually, but not anything that pays decent. And there's not much I can do about it, I feel. I've got people telling me it's about networking and just doing what you can, but I keep thinking about how I should be able to do this myself, I shouldn't have to go beg people to put in a word for me so I can have the chance at a job I'm not qualified for. And I am more terrified of if I don't have a job, then I have to start mooching off my friends, and if that falls through, moving in with my parents again.

I don't really know what I'm trying to say honestly. The system sucks here in America. The economy is in shambles, the job market is a quagmire of fake listings and demands for overqualified-and-underpaid employees, and it feels like you have to lie out of your ass to have the slightest chance of weaseling your way into a decent job.

It's funny too, cause I feel like I can only blame myself for my situation. I failed college hard cause I didn't know what I wanted from life. If I had figured that out, and I had gotten that stupid degree, then maybe things wouldn't be as bad. But then again, I would still be competing for these underpaying jobs. Either way, I'm in debt, my future job prospects look like they're drifting towards more construction, and I don't see a way out.

Thanks for coming to my TED[ious] talk, hope you're doing better than me mentally"

My employer has a habit of making things difficult for me when I'm absent due to chronic illness. I provide a medical note every time, usually the same day. 

Yesterday I was having a bad reaction to some treatments, and I tried to call my work's absent line twice but it wouldn't go through. No biggie I thought, and immediately emailed the call off/absence email to notify them. I didn't specify in the email that I had tried to call previously, but notified them of what was happening, that I would not be in, and that I would be sending documentation once I obtained it. I got the documentation less than an hour later and sent another email, but I either forgot to attach the note to the email or it didn't go through. The medical note put me off for both yesterday and today. 

I logged in to my work computer early today to see if I had any VTO opportunities available to keep my absence from impacting my team attendance rate and saw a message from my boss, saying I would be actioned for a no call/no show from yesterday. I explained that I'd emailed the absence line twice and had documentation. She told me they never received the documentation. I said I'd send it immediately. 

She told me I'd still receive disciplinary action and that they wouldn't accept my documentation as valid for yesterday because I didn't specify in the email that I'd tried to call, and because it wasn't received yesterday. 

Really need guidance guys. This company also threatened to fire me for job abandonment when I was sick for 5 days, called in every single day and emailed documentation for the entire absence. I'm at my wits end."

Well, some time during the first year I was there they switched me to non exempt hourly because of the increase of the minimum salary threshold. I was annoyed at this cause I make 65k and I was thinking just give me 67k to keep be exempt because I hadn't read the policy yet. I'm a really smart worker and I do a lot for my team.

My manager really tried to sell me that this would work in my favor. He said now I'll get paid overtime and that in 2025 I might get 70k which is more than 67k. After doing my own reading by my state, I figured out that actually if I were to be kept exempt they would have needed to pay me 114k because I'm a computing professional according to the subsection. HR's reasoning is that there wasn't enough money to keep me exempt and I call total bull on that considering they pay my manager so much to be incompetent.

Even if they were to pull that I don't qualify as a computing professional they still would've had to pay me 78k which is more than the 70k he was dangling. On top of that he doesn't let me get paid overtime even if I wanted it cause he just has me leave early, so they don't have to. I've been working so much and wearing so many hats because that's just who I was. I can't job hop yet as many of you might know the tech field is going through something at the moment.

6,2024-07-07,Company playing games with reimbursement ,u/FrellMeDead,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dxbkn6/company_playing_games_with_reimbursement/,antiwork,"I had gotten a job with a major pharmaceutical company in their I.T. Department. I was hired during Covid so most of our interaction with fellow coworker, manages, etc were either my phone or through MS Teams meetings. A month into starting this job myself and the other new hires inquired about getting reimbursed for usage is our cell phones since we were required to be reachable at all times during our 12 shifts including meal breaks, etc. All calls had to be forwarded to our cell phones. The reimbursement was approved but the team as well as our main manager/supvervisor. They approved $90 per month per person. 
Due to a lot of issues with mismanagement and honestly pure incompetence a lot of turnover with the other employees occured which resulted in just the team lead and myself being the only two from the original group. During my entire time with this company I repeatedly requested instructions regarding how to file for reimbursement for my cell phone plan. I sent emails and teams messages as well as text messages and even asked during phone calls /meetings to the team lead, payroll, and my supervisor. Each time I would be told to follow a different method to get reimbursed. None of which worked and I complained many times to no avail. I was originally hired as  full time contract worker with an open ended contract (no end date specified), 11 months later they changed my contract without notification /approval to require my contract to be renewed every 6 mouths. Once again they gave me a bunch of nonsense excuses all the while I'm working 80-90 as weeks did to being short-staffed. 
A bunch of other stuff also occurred with them ghosting me after I was supposed to be made permanent full time employee, no reason ever given. This leads into 2.5+ years of working for this company all without ever getting reimbursement and also getting screwed over with my part rate which is another story for another time. 

Anyway during my final three weeks I told my team lead and supervisor that I expect all reimbursement owed to be paid in full before my last day. I had previously submitted copies of the cell phone bill for the first year but apparently they lost them and I couldn't retrieve them anymore due to Sprint being bought by Tmobile. The bill retrieval would only go back so far. I flew complaints with my supervisor's boss and HR, payroll, etc. They don't understand why I want paid but then they play games going back and forth between each other and the company I was contracted through. I've threatened legal action a few times now but honestly would prefer another option since if I have to get legal counsel then I'm going after them for a lot of other violations, issues, etc. I was considering filing a small claims court since I have the large majority of correspondence began us including ones that have them admitting that they owe me the money and then trying to blame anyone they can. 

Question now is what path should I take? I had submitted a year and a half or more of cell phone bills and haven't seen any money for that amount even. I refuse to just let them screw me over after all the other crap they did and pulled against new and others. Any suggestions or recommendations? For clarity I live in Pennsylvania. I also had zero writeups and even got multiple letters of recommendations from both fellow coworkers and 3rd party vendors that we worked with on a daily basis. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just want the money owed to be and to be done with this crappy companies /people.

I didn’t go to a voluntary meeting which I knew nothing about because someone threw a party I didn’t attend

I didn’t go to a mandatory meeting that was scheduled 30 mins before said meeting took place. When they saw I wasn’t there they drove to a beach I was at to get me to go to it. In my soaking wet swimmers I replied: I can’t im wet you should’ve given more notice

409,2024-07-07,Unpopular manager made himself head of new incorporated company while we were striking to remove him,u/JRHEvilInc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dxfvrx/unpopular_manager_made_himself_head_of_new/,antiwork,"I work in education in the UK. Earlier this year, the frontline staff at our school went on strike to demand the removal of an incredibly unpopular headteacher (who had only been in the post for half a year, in which time he'd destroyed staff morale, sent a number of great teachers resigning for greener pastures elsewhere, and instituted a series of sweeping, poorly planned and sudden policy changes). When I say ""frontline staff"", I basically mean everyone except the leadership team - teachers, TAs, cleaners, site team, the receptionist, the librarian. It was a pretty inspiring show of solidarity.

The removal of this headteacher wasn't the only thing we were stiking for, but our union reps (who I have massive respect for as professionals as well as generally) had reached the point where they felt no significant change could occur under his leadership. It was a pretty hostile battle of willpower, with the employee/employer relationship pretty fully breaking down. The Academy Trust (the organisation that oversees our school as well as a number of others) seemed vaguely sympathetic to our concerns, but they stood behind the headteacher and didn't look like they were willing to back down.

We announced strike days in December of last year. At the very last minute, the Trust asked us what change they could make that day to avert the strikes, and we voted on the removal of the headteacher as the only immediate change that could convince us to abandon the strike. They took a middle ground, removing him from site for the remainder of that school term but NOT removing him as head. We cancelled the strikes and had a couple of nice weeks without him.

Then he returned in January. We went on strike a week later for two days. No change occurred, so we went on strike a week later for three days. They stood firm. We announced a strike of four days, with a possible strike of five days being planned in February. Finally, as the Trust finally realised we weren't backing down, they scrambled together on the Friday before our four day strike and announced that the headteacher was moving on to other opportunities. We cancelled the strike and returned to work, and a week or so later they officially announced that he was being replaced by someone new.

(Story is not over yet, but quick aside - join a union, guys. This shit actually gets things done)

Anyway, things haven't been perfect since he left, but they've been MUCH better. Big improvement. But I got curious - what has this headteacher been doing since he messed up a school so badly that the staff went on strike with the sole demand of him leaving? Especially given that he'd been headteacher in at least five different schools since 2018, with the unions getting involved to remove him from at least two of those (I have no evidence for why he left the other three schools, and it's possible one was only ever intended to last for a year as it was a placement abroad). 

Imagine my surprise when I find out that he's incorporated a new private education company and placed himself as headteacher. When did this company get incorporated?

Smack dab in the middle of our strikes.

This guy knew that his removal was our sole demand. He created a new company and made himself headteacher of it. And then he sat back and allowed us to strike for FOUR MORE DAYS. He KNEW he was leaving, he KNEW we were striking to get rid of him, but he allowed the strikes to continue by pretending he was going to stay. 

Now, here's the main reason I'm sharing this story and wondering what you all make of it: I don't know whether the Academy Trust - the headteacher's bosses - knew about this company he made. A local newspaper reported at the start of February that they denied rumours the headteacher was leaving and that he ""remains in his post"". This is two weeks after he incorporated his company with himself as headteacher and shareholder.

So based on UK employment law, do we think he did anything actionable here? Maybe the Trust was just covering for him until his new company had got moving, but I have to believe they didn't know about it. If they DIDN'T know about it, that means they protected him during four days of strike action AFTER he had created a new company for the sole purpose of jumping ship. Is it worth me reaching out to them to bring their attention to it, or is it likely they already know/no law was broken?"

there is genuinely too much lore for me to get into after working here for almost 3 years but i figured you guys would appreciate a text rant to my boss. (lol nevermind, i ended up getting carried away writing this). 

for context, these are messages to my boss after an argument with my manager that started over me only doing one batch on my open this morning. after getting no where with my manager i just decided to message my boss in an attempt to be understood. these texts were right after the argument, i was pretty exacerbated so i don't even know if i got the point across to my boss that i was trying to, but honestly i don't care anymore.  i'm just about done with this job, there's too much to explain to them and i don't think they'd even care to understand if i had articulated my point better lol.

i've heard we are one of the few stores that only has 2 people on opens, true or not my bosses/manager aren't shy about their emphasis on keeping labour costs down. many of my coworkers and i have voiced concerns about being understaffed during open, peak and close, which after working here for so long i know to be true without a doubt. our order times are often terrible, and staff are always staying back on closes because our boss' main priority is cutting down on labour each week despite the stress it puts on us employees. 

when i was asked to step up to a shift runner (manager) position after about a year and a half of working i said no, my manager and the owner kept asking every time they saw me for about 6 months until eventually i just felt like i had to do it. and of course it goes to shit like i knew it would. 

in my time working here i’ve witnessed every person who stepped up to shift running quit shortly after (usually they lasted 2-10ish months), despite having worked here previously for at least 1 year. we all know each other very well here and it was obvious they quit due to the stress of the position and pressure they got from our bosses and store manager. its clear to me that the pressure placed on shift runners to perform perfectly with little support from our manager/bosses is leading to a pattern of unnecessary stress and people quitting.

as an example of this, my coworker-turned-friend that used to work here was one of the best people i've had the pleasure of working alongside. amazing customer service, hard worker, always covered people, and just generally a really happy/outgoing person. she was pretty friendly with our boss and they never used to have issues. she couldn’t see it at the time but this boss in particular was very manipulative toward her and took advantage of her niceness and work ethic. despite them having a pretty good relationship, our boss was quick to critique her and withdrew the niceties at my coworkers smallest mistake. 

as an extension of this, i saw her stay back to finish her closing tasks unpaid on multiple occasions - she was pressured to finish everything without staying back but would be scrutinized for any mistakes. being a hard worker and not wanting to disappoint the boss, she often worked for free to be able to get everything done while keeping labour down and in turn keeping our boss happy. 

one time the store was open until 1 am and i came in around 12am to get food. this coworker was working and when i came in she was clearly stressed and uncomfortable. there was a man hanging around the store causing issues and refusing to leave. i can’t remember exactly what he was doing but i remember it was bad enough that she asked me to stay because she was scared - being the only person in store - and texted our boss asking if she should call the cops. again it was a long time ago and i can’t remember the exact details but essentially our boss didn’t take the situation seriously and acted frustrated toward my coworker as if the situation was her fault. 

all that aside, she never stopped being a good worker but eventually quit due to constantly being understaffed, stressed and treated like shit by our boss despite considering them to have a good relationship and being one of the best workers there. 

my dad raised me to be a hard worker, always go the extra mile and impress the boss. since i started it was made clear to me by managers and my boss, sometimes subtly and sometimes just through direct praise, i was one of the best workers they had - i’m not trying to gas myself up here, it’s just kinda important to this whole shit show. 

however, the work culture has changed the past year and a half-two years to a more toxic place. our manager and bosses incessantly hyperfixate on everyone’s mistakes; mostly in the form of constantly messaging the work groupchat complaining about things that got missed, sometimes valid, sometimes clearly just nitpicking and complaining for the sake of it. either way they never or very rarely compliment good work and instead choose to focus on everyone’s mistakes. while i'm open to criticism in the name of improving myself, as you can imagine this gets very degrading over time and does not foster a good work environment. 



this toxicity is overbearing during especially busy shifts where the manager/bosses will berate staff about load times and other tasks without considering how understaffing and stress is factoring into this. i've witnessed staff members be yelled at by our manager/bosses to the point of tears or very close to it on many occasions and especially over busy weekends and holidays.

over time i’ve started to feel this same stress as my former coworkers and the coworker-friend i discussed above. i’ve been managing for maybe 6-8 months. i often pickup the slack caused by understaffing and i get my job done despite it. obviously i’ve made some mistakes in my time shift running, on particularly hard shifts some dishes will be left in the sink or the floor won't be perfectly scrubbed, sometimes I'm just too tired by the end of the night or so frustrated, or my mental is just fucked up after being on 100 the whole night trying to pick up the slack and keep customers happy. as you can probably assume from what i’ve told you about the toxicity at this job, my mistakes are always broadcasted in the work groupchat. of course some of the complaints - mostly from when i first started shift running and was still learning the ropes - are valid and my mistakes actually impacted the staff who came in after me; for these i was actually apologetic. keep in mind though, majority of the time its small cleaning duties that were missed on a particularly busy close, stuff that could have been sent to me privately, achieving the same thing without the public humiliation ritual. 

during peaks me and my staff feel the pressure of having to do the work of multiple people. i’ve voiced this multiple times, asking for more staff in order to reduce wait times and just end the fucking stress i feel every day. this hasn’t led to any change however and it’s got to the point where i genuinely dread going into work and have started to carry the anxiety i experience at work home with me.

i used to pride myself on being an amazing and reliable worker but after constantly being scrutinized and made to feel like i'm not working to a high enough standard i can feel how the stress and negativity is starting to effect me and my mindset. i don't want this job to change me but i'm starting to think working hard doesn't get you anywhere, it just gets you used and overworked.

Removed some of the walls of text and cleaned it up a bit to be a bit easier to read and digest. Let me know what you think, and any tips, improvements, changes you would suggest! Thanks!

**U.S. Labor Party Action List**

I am typically laissez-faire, but still recognize the need for greater protections and guarantees for Working Class citizens. As such, I can see some concessions being made towards small businesses and start-ups, because it's not my intention to stifle enterprise. But once you start earning enough revenue, then yes, this should be legally applicable.

1. A law that mandates every employee/contractor be paid a direct percentage of the earnings (Including wages, bonuses, travel compensation, stocks/options, vacation, etc.) of the highest paid worker, owner, and/or executive of a company. The CEO is still free to pay themselves as much as they want, but now the janitor's earnings are directly tied to their own.  
2. A law that guarantees overtime pay for working over 32 hours per week. We deserve work-life balance, and the 4-day workweek is gaining traction in the modern world. And no, I don't think 4 10's is a fair compromise, as worker productivity has increased by an incredible amount in the last several decades, and we deserve to benefit from that.
3. A law that mandates a guaranteed 4 weeks vacation time for every working person. This is the norm in many European countries, and we deserve the same.  
4. Universal Healthcare. It shouldn't have ever been tied to employment to begin with. I can't stand seeing people, especially the elderly, being forced to work just to keep their healthcare. It's truly disgraceful.  
5. A law that guarantees either a paid day off, or double time pay for every federally-recognized holiday.  
6. A law that guarantees a Cost of Living Adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index. This DOES NOT waive your right to gain an additional performance-based increase.  
7. A law that guarantees sick days (Including mental health and wellness) without having to go on a whole FMLA leave. If you don't feel well, even if it's as simple as not getting enough sleep or having the mental energy to deal with it today, then you should be able to stay home without your job being at risk.  
8. A law that mandates a guaranteed parental leave for both men and women. It shouldn't even need to be said, much less codified into Law, but you deserve to spend time with your newborn.  
9. Abolish tipping culture. If you as a business need to rely on your patrons to subsidize your worker's earnings, then you can't afford to be a business.  
10. A law that mandates workers be paid at least 5% above their regional living wage before the company begins reinvesting in other projects, like acquiring other properties/assets. This way, the company would be forced to pay their workers fairly instead of simply moving it to other projects and turning out empty pockets with shrugged shoulders when their workers ask for a cost-of-living adjustment."

This is not merely a rant post: I'm exposing the entire entrepreneur class AND the Italian government for the complete failure at providing respectable work conditions, rights, and wages.

I started working a seasonal job fresh out of university due to lack of work for my useless degree (couldn't even find internship). I want to preface that every job I will talk about has been under the table or, at most, came with a contract in no way rapresentative of the actual work done (think on call but I was really full time).

I worked for 7 years in a very successful beach club. I started as a cashier working no less than 10 hours shifts for 3,5€/h at the club entrance. I'm fairly educated and very friendly, also dependable, accurate, and hard working. Within 2 seasons I've been moved to the restaurant cashier doing some light maitre-esque work. On my third season I started working at the bar as a barista for breakfasts and happy hour, my pay was negotiated at 4€/h. I spent 3 seasons tending to the bar, wildly understaffed (think no stop working for no less than 8 hours every day). Around this time my pay was negotiated again to 5€/h. Note that I've been working over 10 hours almost everyday and was never given any extra money for the trouble.

On my 5th season I was known as the centerpiece of the entire stuff. I'm the dude every single costumer knows and asks for when there is any issue and that the owners rely on for literally anything. It is a family run business, and all of them wouldn't be out of place in a psych ward. I've witnessed violence, blatant wage theft, racism, classism, harassment, HUGE tax evasion (about 60% of the income went systematically unreported), you name it. They were also stealing from each other.

On the 6th season the club expanded and reserved the old bar for the restaurant and a new one was built from directly in front of the beach. We also started working evening shifts. On my 7th season I was asked to take a manager role on top of my job for 6€/h for day shifts and 7€/h for evening shifts. I worked 10 shifts per week for over 4 months and was under a TON of stress, fatigued, and constantly being harassed and micromanaged by the owners despite them having negative experience in my role. Everything came to a stop when the shifts I had agreed for the next week with the rest of the staff were scrapped by the son of the owner without notice. He left the shifts uncovered and called me 11 times at 6 am on a monday (after working over 50 hours in 3 days). The rest of the staff told me the shifts were scrapped and I was pissed out of my mind.

I came back to work on the tuesday evening shift. At the end of my shift I went to the office and sat with the son of the owner. A discussion followed that quickly turned sour (insecure pathetic child who can not take criticism), he started shouting and getting worked up, and I had to de-scalate the situation only for him to shout and get angry again a couple minutes later. I stood up, told him to fuck off, and went away. He followed me to the entrance where I stood my ground and waiting for him to do something so I could fuck his face up. He just told me to go away. Next day I showed up for my shift (I work for the owners, not their sons) and he threw me out. The owners immediately begged me to come back, and stupid me did two days later.

On my last week the owner son threatened to punch me in the face if I ever shout in his face again (I didn't). I finished the week, got paid, and went away for good. Most of the bar staff also quit within a couple weeks.

After summer I went to work in a disco-pub for 5€/h. Work environment was better (until it wasn't much later), the staff was amazing, the pay was, again, garbage, but it was 2 minutes from home and the amazing barman taught me everything about his job so I stayied and learned.

It is now summer again, and the last couple months I've been job hunting since the disco-pub is closing during summer (about a month ago).



My last experiences summed up:

- Got an interview for an accounting office job. I accepted a couple weeks of unpaid training. It was a bait and switch. Owners denied having a spot for the job they were advertising and wanted me to do grunt work in the field. Immediately ""quit"".

- Got a job at another beach club for 8,75€/h, on call. After one week I got asked to stay full time (I'm really damn good at my job and have complete experience in every aspect of the service industry) for 5 shifts a week but reduced pay at 7,5€/h. They gave me 7 shifts over 3 weeks but still required full time availability: I quit.

- Two weeks ago I went job hunting and found a job within 30 minutes due to my stellar resumee. It's a new opening. Again, pay is 7,5€/h, but it's 5 minutes from where I live and I would be head barman. I tried negotiating for a better pay (decent pay for a qualified barman in this zone is 8,75€/h) and I was told that we could negotiate again on January. Well, the opening was delayied two weeks with short notice during which I did not work and have been sitting on my ass. If I don't hear from the wannabe owners within 2 days I will tell them I'm out.

I'll maybe even use data from various c-suite jobs allowing for various agents to fill positions. It's not something I'm taking serious at all. I've been using my downtime at work to learn how to program, and I just think releasing it as a jab against CEOs trying to replace real working class people with AI would be funny. I don't care if anyone uses this idea before me, I'd release it as open source anyway, and I'm not looking to spend serious money to pay for the computation needed to make it feature complete. It can be half ass, just like a real CEO. Outside of these companies being litigious spawns of hell or worse (looking at you, Boeing), my main worry is copyright. If anyone wants to help me along my education journey here or contribute in anyway, reach out. Any lawyers with relevant heads up are also welcome. If you steal my idea, just let me submit at least one PR pls. :p

How is it so difficult to find one that fits my bachelor degree? I went to university, studied economics and no one wants to hire me. Apparently i am good enough to invite for an interview, as i had over 10, but not good enough to hire. Everyone is giving lame excuses afterwards to not hire me:

Your profile is overkill for the job, your degree doesn't really fit the job (you contacted and invited me you dumbass), we think you would be bored within a year (so what, i can decide that for myself), we don't have place for a starter (you knew i am a starter, so why even bother inviting me for an interview). I can keep going on with these dumb excuses. And a large portion doesn't even take 2min out of their day to contact you, after you took the effort to come to their fucking office.

Yes, maybe i suck at job interviews, but it is not like im applying for a sales position or whatever. I apply for jobs that work with numbers. I cannot fake enthusiasm. ""I am so grateful to have gotten the opportunity to apply for such a great company that is specialized in *insert whatever boring thing they do*, i am so stoked to help you guys reach greater achievements"". The interviewer also knows it is bullshit. 

One even adviced me to continue to get a masters degree, while having a job on the side. And if i dont like the degree, finish it anyways and start a new one afterwards. 

I won't do that at all as i just know i will mentally destroy myself by doing so.

Why is it so difficult to get a fucking job. Why is it apparently the societal norm to have a masters degree. Why is having a job next to being a full time student normalized. 

And don't get me started about fucking Linkedin. It is a cesspool of circlejerking. Reading posts makes you feel like shit and like your achievements are worthless and like you are behind on everyone. And the fucking language on there being ""professional"". NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT, IT IS FUCKING CRINGE. It is like everyone is keeping a fairytale alive, knowing it is fake, yet they all go along in it. I refuse to believe anyone likes to use linkedin, let alone likes using Linkedin language. 

The only reason i have linkedin is for the recruiters, but that hasnt had the prefered result so far. One recruiter even refused to send me to an interview after a 30min phonecall. He would then search for more jobs and send them to me, surprise surprise, never heard from him again. 

Everyone is making it way more complicated then it ever needs to be. You are on your own and no one gives a shit, every employer only wants you because you benefit them short term and they are not willing to teach you anything at all cause that means you benefit from them and they dont benefit from you short term, and god forbid that."

I work as a systems administrator with a 5 man team including my boss. We support the colleges virtual infrastructure and various servers. Roughly 600 virtual servers and horizon instant clones. We are also responsible for Windows OS patching and security, storage infrastructure, application management, associate databases, and any random projects my boss decides he wants to eat up. 

At the start of my job my boss made it clear my previous experience doesn't matter. What matters is what I can do for him and the team. I'm always one of the first people to jump on in an emergency after hours. I've also solved a lot of problems affecting other IT areas that people had been working on solving for years. My boss doesn't give me bad ratings. But everything to him is an emergency that needs to be done asap. He tells me he feels like sometimes I'm an amazing employee then horrible. Apparently the reason for this is because I don't want to send in a 3 or 4 hour teams call with him not getting any work doneor I'm with a customer and he feels I should catering to him.We're in constant meetings for new projects and during working hours I don't have time to get everything I need done. He's since told me he needs me to get work done during normal hours. We don't have time. We have recently started to support the application side of things as well and video surveillance for the campus police. I am an exempt employee, but with none of the benefits. No flexibility on my end. I think his micromanaging has finally got to me. The other thing is we have a DBA team, and I've picked up doing all the DBA stuff on our teams end because they were hard to deal with. I make about 73k a year and was teaching on the side, he's pretty much told me I'm not allowed to teach after work hours in case he needs me. Our director put down another IT worker for an issue that wasn't his responsibility. It's put a really bad taste in my mouth. I can't send an email with out my boss CC on it. He has fits if I leave it off. He has political wars with an employee who called hr on him and is always trying to get him fired. We get dragged into it.

Has this been anyone else's experience in education? 

I'm debating about leaving education. And see if a municipality is better. Working culture seems so terrible everywhere. I guess we have all just screwed up by working instead of fighting for what we want. Sorry my thinking is disorganized.

Last month our rats started dying off. We thought food was contaminated, switched their diet, but they kept dying. Everyone started pitching in more to ensure dead rats were removed and dying rats were humanely euthanized. Wasn’t until a few weeks in that the owner realized we lost thousands of dollars worth of animals. So he decided to finally consult some experts and took some rats in for necropsy. 

They had an extremely contagious and deadly form of Streptococcal pneumonia. There was basically a 100% fatality rate in infected rats. Worse than this major research facility has ever seen. Zoonotic and absolutely fucking contagious. We lacked the basic sanitary practices to prevent both the introduction and spread. 

I’d been advocating for culling since we realized it wasn’t the food. Very out of character for me, as I’ve gotten in trouble for caring too much about our animals. But I am knowledgeable enough about animal disease to know something really bad was happening. And to figure out the likely route of transmission (water bottles). My coworkers were holding out hope that not all the rats would succumb to it. None of us wanted to see all the rats die. 

When we got those results, I finally got the go ahead to euthanize the remaining 22 infected rats. I am a little traumatized, but I know it was for the best and I prevented them from suffering anymore. Now we begin the process of changing our operating procedures, and despite being the only person with experience in a sanitary animal facility (and apparently the only one with an understanding of basic cleaning procedures), I’m already having my input dismissed. 

And as an added bonus? I got a 50¢ raise but my hours got cut so I actually make $40 less a week now, and I got rejected from a better job in animal care. I’m broke, trapped, and still coping with having to kill so many animals. I mostly love the work I do and helping my customers take better care of their critters. I just can’t get past the fact that I have unknowingly been putting my life at risk for this shit."

At the company I work for all FTE are paid on salary and only expected to work X amount of hours per week. It’s in our employment contracts that OT is never paid or allowed to be banked, and therefore OT is never expected or ever asked of us.

A colleague of mine (I’ll refer to them as Jaime) has been working large amounts of OT for months. Last month they worked nearly 60 hours of OT alone. Jaime is telling people they volunteered their time to do the extra work. AKA They worked 60 hours for no compensation.

Deep down I am floored. I don’t feel I can really do or say much because it’s not my problem so to speak, and Jaime seems to see nothing wrong with it …. but it’s mind blowing. On the one hand, it makes me frustrated that my boss is totally taking advantage and not advocating for us. A good manager would not have given someone this workload to begin with, but also should be holding people accountable for working any unpaid overtime and preventing it. At the same time, Jaime is also a senior team member and supposed to be setting an example for junior team members. 

To add to this, we are a tech company and we have no perks or benefits. We only get bare minimum legally required 2 weeks vacation per year and no perks like extra PTO over the summer or Christmas holidays, 4 day work weeks or even a pension or retirement matching. We get none of that. We also get 0 optional stat holidays off. For Christmas this year they did absolutely nothing for employees — no holiday bonus, no little holiday party, no card or little company gift, no leaving early on Xmas eve or extra days off — no nothing to show any ounce of appreciation. 

Why on earth would anyone want to go above and beyond and work for free for a company that legitimately stoops as low as they can go and does not care about us?! They would fire anyone in a heartbeat for the sake of the business. Work is a business transaction of your time, skills & expertise in exchange for money and benefits. Never volunteer your time for 0 compensation, to make millions of dollars for someone else that doesn’t care about you!

I am very proud of how I didn’t let my own work ethic drop during my time there though and they constantly said I was their best employee (cause the people they hired were turds and got lucky with me tbh). I left with as much grace as could be given with the current situation and thanked them for their time and never burned bridges. I still don’t even want to give them the opportunity to mess up my chances of employment elsewhere as a reference so I have two options when an interviewer asks why I left:

1)  Is it better to tell them the truth, when asked about why I left, and say my previous employer is not a reference because they were extremely unprofessional and toxic and just state it’s a them issue and not a me issue or

2)  Should I just lie and use a friends number in place of theirs? "

It's a shame because sometimes the job seems like something I'm interested in, but I'm way past the age of just ""working for experience"" and I need to plan my life too. I can't waste my time going to an interview and then finding out the salary isn't enough for me to pay my bills or that the benefits are actually exploitation. 

Like just put the salary on the job description? I bet if I showed up with no CV and just expected them to hire me just because, they wouldn't. So why should I accept a job just for the job and not for the pay? "

The reason they do this is because they need to finish their task within a specific time or they will get in trouble. If they take their lunch, it will take time away from completing their task. If they don't take their lunch breaks, the manager will get mad because everyone is required to do so according to the department of Labor, and they don't want to get fined by them for employees not taking breaks. 

I tried telling the manager that the work they give us is too much work but they won't listen nor care. And the CO workers that do this tell me not to report it to anyone because they don't want to get in trouble. What should I do? "

I have a manager (let's call them V) who is the worst. Not only the usual bad manager stuff (barely does their job, doesn't help out when needed, constantly going outside for a smoke, etc.) but they've also threatened to assault my coworker (at least three times to her face), promoted off a bunch of food for their family (well over our $10 limit), and has made work hell. I, as well as a few other coworkers, have gone to management about this. Our managers are on our side and have gone to their higher-ups and beyond. 
The issue is that absolutely nothing has been done. No write up, no talking to, absolutely nothing.
So today after work I plan on writing an email to my company's HR about their treatment towards their staff and coworkers and the amount of food she's promoted off/taken home. My request is for any advice you guys can give. This is the first and only time I've emailed our HR and I know what to say generally but I want to be sure what I'm saying gets through to them and that they finally handle this one way or another!!
So please, any advice is appreciated, even words of encouragement or stories of similar stuff would be very useful!!

I also disclosed that I'm disabled because they were being discriminatory. After months of calling me weird now they also spy and gossip because they also don't believe that I'm disabled (I've been working here for less than 4 months and am not even from this state)

I've had a lot of men including my managers shove me. 

I don't want to share too much of what I went through for privacy but it's wildly illegal, childish, and sometimes violent or sexual 

I haven't been here for 6 months and I think I will be leaving with trauma aside from what mentally ill customers have done so far

The issue is when I started the job I was told that my schedule would be Monday-Sunday as scheduled 9 am - 5 pm and 5 days a week. It was on the paperwork I signed stating my job responsibilities and in our employee handbook it only states that “it is DESIRED that employees work at least two events” not REQUIRED. This is also applicable for all departments not just the docents department. 


Many of us have outside responsibilities (kids, pets, grandchildren, etc) and are unable to work outside of our 9-5 hours. Another thing is we work downtown and many of us feel very comfortable walking to our cars when it’s dark. We’ve had numerous break ins in the provided employee parking lot and some of us take public transport that isn’t always as accessible and consistent in the evenings. 

This may sound dumb but is it legal for your job to require you to work hours outside of your availability in this manner? HR nor the public programs department gave us any paperwork to sign about this new change and I may need to look for another job ow that this job doesn’t work with my availabilty. Mostly frustrated because they don’t seem to care about our outside responsibilities and we do not get paid enough to put up with their bullshit. If they are so worried about not being staffed during events then they should create a policy where every staff member has to volunteer for an event not just one department. "

I have been there over three years and have lately been feeling more and more stressed due to work loads, and work piling up even while out on weekends, vacations etc. in my three years I have seen probably over a hundred people come and go. It is a high turn over position that most people look at and nope out of within a week or two. Example...work loads can be relentless. There isn't good training. People call you constantly while you are trying to figure things out. New claims are given each day even while you have back claims that need attention. Essentially it can be like a game if Tetris where management will watch you slowly be buried and do nothing.

 People constantly call. And there are many things that you simply can not help with. Metrics are given and held against you for things you have no control over. Example...if I get a voice mail while I'm on vacation or on the weekend, it's added to a metric called ""calls to voicemails"" and it's held against me. If that number is too high you get disciplined. I'm coming back from a vacation Monday and I am already stressed due to the number of voicemails, emails, messaged and claims I was not able to get to while on vacation and was provided no coverage for.

I have a decent amount of money saved. I won't say how much exactly but it is enough to live off for probably 2-3 years if living conservatively or only paying rent, food utilities. Cutting back on expenses it's doable. I don't want to live off savings and just quit but my god there has to be a less stressful solution right? "

Today, I got called out in front of my team by my supervisor. She was checking the PTO schedule for our team and noticed that I had barely used mine. She pointed out that I have only used 9 days of PTO out of the 25 that I have, and it's already July. She basically said that if I don't use my PTO, I will lose it, as I can only carry over 5 days to the next year.

She doesn't care if I come to work 5-10 minutes late as long as I get my work done on time. She also doesn't mind if I take my 1-hour lunch break at 11 am or 1 pm.

The best thing, in my opinion, is how she fought with management to get our team a 5% salary increase.

The funny thing is that my team outperforms any other team in the department despite my supervisor's relaxed attitude. It's almost as if treating employees as adults and stopping micromanagement improves performance.

Before I went two weeks ago, I wrote the report of our big monthly reunion. As usual, my coworkers read it before sending it to the chief.

This morning, one of my two coworkers told me she had to rewrite almost everything to elaborate further, that she was tired of having to correct the report I submit every month m, that she would like for once not to correctvmy work and know that she would just have to send it, with maybe some more details, but not rewrote over everything. She feels like I rely on them to correct whatever I do, but I don't. I don't have the input of my second colleague as he will be there this afternoon only.

I submit weekly, shorter report as well, that my second colleague read. Hebdidnt make much adjustment for the past couple of months, so apart from the few corrections/readjustment (where he calls me up to stand next to him and tell him what I meant when I wrote X or Y), I thought I was good on my reports. Before I went on vacations though, he scolded me for one of my planning I thought was good, but he didn't agree at all. I had a vision that was not his, and I completly froze when I tried to explain it to him after he (gently) mocked me.

I stressed over my return from vacation for 2 weeks, because everytime I come back, I know I would have screwed something up. I have been here for a year now, but I still make stupid mistake due to innatention. I wrote myself some liste not to forget anything when I write my reports or when I do my plannings, but it doesn't seem to be enough. Still, when I write something that I submit to my coworkers, I don't plan on them redingote all the work, I genuinely give them what I thought at the time was my best ! I used to write too wordy, too complicated reports, and my first coworkers asked me to tone it down. I thought I had found the proper balance, but apparently not, since she had to rewrite everything. 

What can I say to convince them that I don't rely on them to correct my work, that I genuinely submit what I think is my best ?"

This is just a conspiracy but it’s something that i’ve been connecting the dots on…

1)Call it “Feminism” or whatever but overtime things have change and Women were eventually forced into the workforce…they couldn’t afford to stay home regardless
Whether they chose to or not isn’t the point hear me out… but now Men and Women are now in the workforce…no more stay home parents.

2) with both genders working leaving no time to raise kids apps like “TikTok and Instagram” are effectively raising the next generation of mindless kids that listen and do whatever the app tells them to without thinking twice about it
and this is proven to be extremely dangerous, and even more so EFFECTIVE. My sister is in honors classes in the 9th grade and doesn’t know her multiplication tables but knows everysingle tik tok trend…🤦 how is that even possible 


3) with the effective death of overtime people are now locked and forced to work more time under the trap of a “Salary” and with inflation and the economy getting worse every year people can’t afford to just work 1 job  they have to work multiple jobs just to survive effectively having people “live to work” and people are realizing this.

4) With the Forcible Goverment/ School/ AND media push of the LGBTQ+ pride agenda no one knows what a man or woman is anymore and no one can explain the difference… and those with the common sense to tell otherwise are called homophobic and shamed and or cancelled and end up losing their job just for voicing a different opinion…
effectively creating a future where “there is no more gender
(not homophobic but everyone is entitled to there own opinion on sexuality, and those who disagree shouldn’t have the entitlement to destroy others lives because some don’t agree with it..). it makes no sense how men are able to compete in women’s sports 🤦

5) The government illegally listens and stealing cookies and information from public citizens and in turn end up know what we want, and when we want it at any given moment Stealing our (Face ID/ FingerPrints/ and Voices and not deleting or storing this information but them using to do what ever they want… This goes on in airports nowadays… They have your Face/ Finger print/ Voice/ Name/ and your search history since you’ve owned a device…the government illegally knows who you are inside and out without ever meeting you and is using to feed into our overconsumption 

6) With the exponential increase in brainless distractions no wonder everyone is depressed and brainless… Social media mindless doom scrolling/ Hours wasted on video games/ Always a new streaming service and Tv Show/ Porn etc people are Having the dopamine sucked out of them at all points of the day leaving them content with the “ lifeless life” that they are living and not leaving them enough brain power to rebel again the world.

7) We have a record breaking number of depressed individuals and An even crazier amount of people on a day to day basis taking anti depressents and if you don’t know what those drugs do they pretty much make you feel like a zombie…

None of these things are  coincidence…. they are all happening overtime to create a world or brainless, gender less, corporate slaves that live to do nothing but be “worker bees” to make the billionaires on this earth richer
and those that don’t follow this new regime and agenda are pushed out/ shunned/ and systematically killed

Slavery Has never left it’s just becoming more advanced and we are falling right into it as we speak

We as a humanity need to rebel against this and fight for our “humanity”

I'm a nurse by trade, but when I wad ""let go"" from my last nursing job about 18 months ago, I work as a delivery driver. Although, I'm very satisfied in my current job, I keep an eye on nursing openings just in case. For the past few months, I've noticed a tendency from the large healthcare groups in my country to settle the job market lower for wages (because during the COVID years, you could name your price). Three weeks ago, hoping to satisfy my curiosity, I applied on one of the Big Three healthcare providers for a nurse position. Here is my experience:

1) I went through a four interviews. Only on the last one was the wage discust.
2) The first three interviews were basically a sales pitch: how good the benefits are, how prestigious the brand, etc.
3) On the final, done by the Head of Nursing and the Head of HR, I was asked what range of pay I was expecting. I gave them my number (based on 13 years of experience). I saw the HR guy flinch and thought that I wouldn't get an offer.
4) Friday morning I received their offer, which was the following (wage and benefits):
- 13% above minimum wage (my offer was about 40% above minimum wage)
- 50 euros of food stamps every two months
- 15% off on a yearly subscription for a gym chain owned by one of the board members 
- 10% off for a meal for two on a burger chain owned by a board member; but only if it is up to 20 euros (usually a single cheeseburger there costs 11 euros).
-50 euros of coupons to by new shoes every year from a chain that a board member is a shareholder.
-Lastly, and the most absurd IMHO, paid OT! By law, all OT is paid...

Anyways, I declined and today I received an enquiry by their recruiting team as to why. I replied that the offer wasn't good. They replied back ""but the benefits are excellent and the prestige you can add to your CV working here is a huge bonus"". I replied with the title of the post. Haven't heard from them since."

My previous job that I left due to the hours no longer being compatible with family care, paid 22.55 after 2.5 years of working there.

Today I called the branch manager of the new job to ask if there was room for negotiation on the pay, as my resume is extensive in the field I'm in.  The conversation went exactly:

Me:  ""I was just curious if there was room to negotiate the pay.""
Manager:  ""There is not.""
Me:  ""Ah.""
Manager:  ""Yep.""
Me:  ""Okay.""
Manager:  ""Yep, have a good day.""  *hang up*

Reading reviews for this company on a job site also point out this branch manager at this location telling people they're ""not putting in enough effort"" when working 60+ hours a week.

Fast forward a couple of days, the same exact job is back up on the website with a change to the qualifications, now potentially disqualifying me as a candidate when previously I was perfect for it. It’s incredibly disheartening. I don’t know what happened behind the scenes, but it feels wrong.

13,2024-07-08,I LOST Money Being Employed Here. Restaurant woes,u/JaegerSpit,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dy8wkf/i_lost_money_being_employed_here_restaurant_woes/,antiwork,"  This situation is fifty shades of F*****. I'm honestly astounded, and just figured I'd post. There's some stuff that is definitely on me, (I'm big on personal accountability), but the incompetence I've seen at this spot was astonishing. I'll put a TLDR at the bottom for the folks who don't want to read my essay. To skip straight to the company that cost me money, move 4 paragraphs down.

   I'm a restaurant guy. Started in fast food, made my way up to fine dining. I enjoy the industry because it is performance-based. You get skill checked every time it gets busy, and if you're doing poor, you know right then and there. It is tense and stressful, but you can always think back and review where you went wrong and then try to ensure that whatever f***** you up doesn't happen again. That specifically is what separates the skilled kitchen folks from the trash ones. 

   After around 12 years in the industry, I started getting burnt out pretty bad. My mistake was jumping around job to job to increase my skillset, so I didnt really have roots anywhere. I neglected my mental health for a hot minute, buried the depressive stuff by my favorite mantra: ""stop being a ***** and do better"". It worked for most of those twelve years lol. I earned the title of Chef, ran a very successful steakhouse, tightened up food cost, labor, and guest experience. And then the owner calls me a p**** because I'm only doing 65 hours a week instead of 80? Peace out man ✌️ 

   Said screw it, took a regular line cook job at a reputable darden restaurant. I had a real bad depressive episode when my hours got cut due to corporate shenanigans. I just needed 40 hours, was never was able to get past 35 Went down a mean depressive spiral and went off to find something different, hopefully out of the industry. I just hit 28, and i need some benefits before things in my body start breaking down-breaking down. 

     Trying to get out of the industry was tough, and it almost broke me lol. I've got three years experience running a multimillion dollar steakhouse, general manager experience, and a baller resume, but I can't even snag an interview to work at a call center? Or retail? Anything entry level? Lmao wtf. Tried to rely on my old reliable mantra ""stop being a *****, just do better"". Alright, let's revamp the resume and include some keywords ai looks for in customer service, office, and managerial positions. No bites. Alright, let's pound the pavement and drop my resume off to people directly (retail). Nothing. Alright, its been too long, let's try any and all call center/customer service places on Indeed and ziprecruiter. Getting broke, let's start to donate plasma now. Don't panic, just do better. And then cue a horrible depressive episode/existential/midlife crisis, and bam, I'm damn near rock bottom. 

By the time I pulled myself out of it, I had no phone, no car insurance, and I was down $300. I reviewed my options, and found a corporate breakfast kitchen nearby. Less than a mile away, so I could at least drive there and back without being too sketchy, because if I get pulled over my car is impounded. The restaurant is way below what i usually do, but I'm in a bad spot, I need to just humble myself and get back on the grind, I've got noone to help me except for me. 

They hired me on May 24, for the oh-so-impressive wage of 16.50/hr. ""In 30 days, we can do another dollar after your training. Come back next Thursday for orientation."" Alright, May 30th orientation. The young manager who did my orientation was unprofessional and trash talked the other managers. Whatever, don't care, let's get rocking. 

   She mentions two of the guys there get 50 hours a week, and I ask how that doesn't tank labor. She says it does, but they account for it. My exact thoughts on the matter were: Duly noted. Perform well, and I can get 45 hours easy, and I'll be good. She tells me to come back for food handler certificate training and plate guide. Tries to make it June 6th, but I convince her we can do that on June 3rd, the following Monday instead. I explain I'm in a tight spot and need to work, if they can help me out I can do whatever they need in that kitchen.

 I do my stuff on June 3rd, it's all good. She says next week we'll start. We'll, it's a Monday and there is a whole week in which we can get trained up and ready for the weekend. I ask and kind of insist that I'm ready to work ASAP. She refers me to the assistant general manager who is derping around in the office. I say hi and introduce myself and ask if there is any way I could start this week. She gives me a hard no, stating that it is father's day weekend and they don't train on mondays and tuesdays. I ask for Wednesday or Thursday, because I'll be good for the weekend after a couple shifts. She puts a hard no on that, I'm guessing she hasn't seen the resume. Alright, I shouldn't try to rock the boat, I have very few options at this point. 

   They have weekly pay, and the option to pull pay out right after the shift you've worked. Fast forward to June 12th. I start working. The cooking is as horrible as I expected, but the crew is nice and I'm able to get along with everyone. Keep my head down, do everything to corporate specs, have fun with the crew, keep it pushing. I'm pretty competent within the first few days, as I said. 

   On my third day, I see the General Manager back from vacation. She smiles at me and asks if I want lots of hours, which is odd and her smile was creepy af. I respond with an ""I sure do"" and a confident smile and keep it pushing til the 19th. 

   My benefits need to be done and applied for within the first 30 days of employment. I cannot apply for the benefits without money down. On the 19th, I ask if we can finally set up direct deposit. They tell me I have to use the card they offer, because direct deposit takes two weeks to set up. Mkay, let's use the card, I'm broke let's go. We try to set up the card, manager can't. Says screw it, we'll handle it tomorrow. On the 20th, we try to set up the card. Can't do it. This weekend is magically the weekend they are switching payroll software for the whole company. 

I keep working, as they have assured me they will square it away after launch weekend. 

It's the 26th. I go to the AGM, saying hey, I haven't been paid can we please square this away. We have issues with the system, can't sign into my schedule or my payroll because they input the wrong phone number. We switch the numbers, but I can't verify the number and log in because my phone is off.

   We go back and forth trying to figure things out, and I'm playing calm even though I'm STRESSING at this point. Then she tells me I should be getting a paper check for the training(7.25/hr for the computer and plating stuff, then the EXTRAVAGANT 16.50 for the first week. Wowee). I say alright, I'll swing by a little early on Friday and pick it up. She says no, it will come to your house in the mail in 7-10 days. 

   Politely and calmly, I explain the situation. She tries to get stuff square and does her best, talks to payroll and gets my direct deposit set up in the system. I'm still f***** though. She said she would overnight it to the store but can't. I don't remember why they couldn't, because I was trying very hard not to pop off or make a scene. I mellow out because freaking out doesn't help anyone.

They have me off Saturday, and I ask if there is any way we can see if someone wants the day off and I'll take their spot. Or if they're late, is it okay for me to 'shark' their shift. She says no to both, and writes down my schedule for the next week. It's 27 hours. 

I can't believe it. I am so lost and confused at this point. I zoned out staring at that sticky note, a sense of dread and hopelessness clutching my heart. I'm completely knocked on my ass. I'm a top performing kitchen professional, doing exactly what is needed, and having a good attitude while doing so. I look from the sticky note and into this woman's eyes and ask her quietly, ""What the f**** is this?"". 

  She explains that it's the best she can do. I ask if there is ANYTHING I can pick up, I'll even do dish. She says she might be able to let me help put away the truck on Tuesday. I can't even talk, I just look hopelessly at this lady. She asks what's wrong. 

  She's not a bad person, and was trying* to help. I explained the whole situation, as calmly as I could, but some emotion definitely bled through. I made sure to keep distance and keep sitting down in the chair. Nobody wants a tatted up kitchen guy with a buzz cut getting aggressive, and I wasn't trying to scare the lady.

     I explained the hire process, how long it took to get on, how my rent is due and if I can't swing anything I will get an eviction notice, I've been there almost a month with f*** all to show for it, if the payroll was switching why did they not get me squared away in the three weeks prior to the switch, why was everyone blowing smoke up my ass about hours this whole time if 27 was the best they could do. I tried to be chill, but there was some definitely gesticulating and hand clapping. I'm southern and riled up, I truly couldn't help that last bit. 

I end by asking a simple question: ""I've done what all I needed to do, to the letter. Why are you guys f****** me right now?"" She didn't have an answer. It was so absurd, so ridiculous, that a management team could be so incompetent. I NEVER THOUGHT a corporate restaurant would be shiesty with the pay, you usually only find that in mom n pop shops. I was about to start crying in the office so I stood up, and left. 

   Earlier I mentioned a depressive episode. That was just a teaser trailer because the depressive breakdown was starting up. I get home and get in the shower and start sobbing. Then trying to get it together. Then sobbing again. Rinse and repeat that for the next seven hours. Utilities due, rent due, no insurance, no phone. Lol I couldn't call the suicide hotline even if I wanted to. Rock f****** bottom dude. But even at rock bottom, the old mantra ""don't be a *****, do better"" was still around. 

I was able to get a little hustle on, make and sell some baked goods of the intoxicating variety. I could only make $400 hustling as hard as I could. Take 100 of that out for gas and food, and I was still a grand short. Credit isn't good, but I took out a loan with an obscene interest rate. Like, I don't even want to say on here what the percentage is, it's that bad. 

I got the training check in the mail, that they put a rush on. It was a WHOPPING $236. Lolol it was just enough to pay off my bank overdrafts. With that loan, I was able to dodge the eviction notice. With my less than legal side hustle, I was able to get insurance on the car and a cheap phone from Walmart. I'm $1600 down, and it's been two weeks since I left, and I STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY ACTUAL MONEY FROM THAT COMPANY. 

   Good thing I save all of my clock out slips 😉. Now, a lot of this is my fault for letting myself get into this position. I should have seen the writing on the walls and tried to go elsewhere when it took over two weeks to get working. I should have been on their ass about pay day 1 of me working. 

    In my defense, I had three different managers assure me of hours, I performed adequately for the role, and to be honest I was fighting a mental battle the entire time. How was I supposed to know they'd screw me so hard? After interest, stress, and suffering, this job has literally cost me more than any other. 

The 4th of July holiday weekend had all the main offices closed. I will be making what I can only assume is the first of many calls to the company's HR department in just a few minutes. I'm down bad, mentally and financially. Almost tried something concerning the other day, but im going to get my goddamn money first. 

I was able to get hired at a scratch kitchen nearby. I start Wednesday. We set up direct deposit the day I was hired. 


TLDR: FELL ON BAD TIMES. TOOK BAD JOB. BAD JOB SLOW JERKED AND PROMISED MUCH, DID NOT DELIVER. INCOMPETENCE SCREWED MY PAY AND I DIDNT GET PAID FOR ANY OF THE ACTUAL WORK I DID. HAD TO TAKE A LOAN TO KEEP THE ROOF OVER MY HEAD. LOAN WILL COST MORE THAN IVE MADE AT THE COMPANY. 

STILL HAVENT RECIEVED PAYCHECK WITH MOST OF MY HOURS. WILL CALL HR. WILL CONTACT DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IF HR DOESNT PLAY BALL. I SUCK FOR GETTING IN THIS SITUATION, BUT MANAGEMENT SUCKS SO HARD I CAN ONLY CLASSIFY THEIR SKILLSET AS 'MALEVOLENT INCOMPETENCE'."
16,2024-07-08,Being targeted by my boss and manager,u/Something-5161,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dy8zm1/being_targeted_by_my_boss_and_manager/,antiwork,"Despite working as 4 people and have contributed so much to the company's success, I was rated 3/5 for my performancd review and no promotion or bonus. My manager didn't provide much context and couldnt provide me any proof of such rating. 

I then found out through a co worker that the boss and the manager didn't like me and blamed me on our recent group discussions. 

We recently went through lots of difficult discussions with the whole team together because we believed we were overworked and the management team was not listening or supportive. However,  somehow the manager and the boss told everyone that I was the one who complained about everything and spreaded the negativity to other people causing them to stress out about their work conditions.

Mind you, I am the only people of color in the company. And we all came together because we shared the same experiences of the negative treatment from the management team. 

I just want to vent and see if people have any resolution. I have been actively looking for another job and hopefully I will get out of this place soon!

It was a message from a flustered-sounding hiring manager. He was inviting me to an interview, stating that he had emailed me earlier in the day and I hadn't responded. They were trying to set up interviews for Thursday in particular (6 days hence). Sorry for the short notice. Please just respond to the email and let me know if you're interested. 

Here are the red flags I spotted: 

* It's 6:20pm on a Friday. Why are you calling me at this time of day? Just after a holiday? Were you expecting me to pick up? 
* That email was sent at 4:24pm. You are worried because I didn't respond within two hours?

As you can see, i work in field but i manage up level 2 tech support and that's the role i applied for and got stuck here, Unorganized company, big mistake of having address in CV and this man doesn't like people leaving his company in good terms until they fight until they can leave. so this is the only option left for me to leave. if i say something i want to be in this position he is like ok we will plan and then just says do this and do that, so this is i work in field like a dog, labour work is more reputable than this work. its not first time telling him clearly what i wanna do, this is more then 3rd time and he makes me give him a excuse of me changing career or leaving country, but the idiot comes to home to see for himself. 

  
My response is not goanna chance anything either, my response is gonna be, NO to all of this and its gonna be i wanna be L1/L2 Inhouse only no going on the roads no touching grass, is my deal. if you think this excuse is not enough help me with better idea."

Now they can look like they tried something but it didn’t work out because no one wants to work 4 day work weeks. In reality, the whole point of a 4 day work week is to try and get the same amount done in less time. Cut out all the nonsense we waste time on and find more efficient ways of doing things. 

ASDA: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/08/asda-scrapping-physically-exhausting-4-day-workweek-why-it-can-fail/

3083,2024-07-08,Was denied my yearly pre-approved raise. Boss directly stopped it from happening.,u/Ok_Apricot5840,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dyax9a/was_denied_my_yearly_preapproved_raise_boss/,antiwork,"I’m a contractor for a tech company who needed staff for 12 months. My contract got extended for an additional year, despite me completing the goal 3 months ahead of time. This makes sense because they were short staffed. 

Last month, near my one year mark, I asked for a raise from my contracting company as they are the ones who issue my paycheck. They asked me to provide reasons on why I believe I deserve the raise. They said they don’t normally give out raises since they hire contractors who work for short increments of time, but will reach out to the tech company I am contracted with. My reasons are as follows (shortened version):

1) Due to my expertise in the field, I was able to complete the goal 3 months ahead of time, and have since took on additional responsibilities not listed in the contract description. 
2) I have worked on 4 projects for various teams around the company in places where they were lacking, and increased profit by X percent by helping those teams meet project deadlines. 
3) In my spare time, I did an audit on previous work that dated back to 7 years. I marked back inconsistencies within each project for over 75 projects. 

All three are BEYOND my responsibilities. My contracting company approved a 10% raise because it was within the companies budget, and they only needed confirmation from my boss and my bosses boss. I heard back from the tech company and my boss has declined to give me a raise as they don’t see me going above and beyond in “leadership”. No elaboration beyond that whatsoever.

I was genuinely taken aback. My boss has never brought up a single complaint against me, or has ever suggested a change in my work. In fact he has only ever complimented me and applauded me for the work I’ve done. 

Ever since his character has been sour to me. He does not ask how are you, does not smile, or engage in a single conversation outside of work. This is a complete turnaround from his behavior before.

I’ve already gotten over the emotional aspect of this whole thing and am genuinely wondering why he would reject a pre approved raise after only having complimented my work.

I have been working in an 8-5 desk job that drains me mentally. It's too much thinking about complicated stuff that I absolutely do not care about. I get paid $17 an hour with benefits, and this is the best paying job I've had but I dread every second being here.

Unfortunately I live in a small town with very limited opportunities, especially for jobs with benefits. Still, I really want to just quit and work an easier job.

I'm in my late 20s and live with my family still and if I do this they will give me a hard time about not having insurance. I completely understand why, I need the insurance anyways, but this job is grinding me down mentally.

For several months I've started to develop a lot of su1cidal ideation. It's becoming habitual thinking that this is my only solution to my problems, and that scares me. It's pouring into other areas of my life too, where the solution to any problem is to nope out. 

I don't know if I should just quit, work an easier job, and face the consequences of no insurance and disapproval from family or just try to grind through this job. I'm starting to fear that my suic1dal thoughts will get out of hand. I just want some peace of mind.

My mental health is not great to begin with, but I've been able to manage.

Can't have higher wages. Can't have destigmatization of addressing mental health needs. But we will make damn sure that \*every\* type of call--even just a 10 minute check-in with a client--still has to be over video, and people think you're some kind of freak if your camera is turned off too often.   
  
Not to mention, it's way more aggravating to have to sit in a video chat for 10-15 minutes so you can still have the call if a person's late. If they don't show up, then you go through the hassle of emailing them to see if they're available later in the day, or if another day works better, and scheduling another video call, hoping it's not gonna be another waste of time. And this isn't taking into account the possible the video/sound quality or tech problems.

Meanwhile, if a person missed a phone call: ""Hey X, this is Y, just wanted to touch base about (insert topic here). Gimme a call back when you get a chance. Thanks, bye."" Maybe I'll send them a follow-up email if it's urgent. Takes about 3 minutes tops.

I hate the fundamental aspect of life that one has to work to survive. Be it anything, really. It doesn't matter if it's a factory or some ""dream job that I would do anyway."" Simply the concept of work drives me insane, and I would sooner hang myself than do it like a robot. I have seriously contemplated suicide because I do not want any job, and nothing has ever been able to change my attitude towards things. Neither psychologists, psychiatrists, nor any medication. But honestly? I don't even want to change my worldview, even if it costs me my life. I don't care if I freeze to death as a homeless person; nothing will click in a good direction for me, and if I die, so be it, but work is so revolting that I won't go near it.

Every job description I read sounds miserable, no matter how much they pay for it. I'll write it down here again: it doesn't matter what the task is, even if it's video editing work that I like to do at home for 5 hours a week. The fact that I would have to spend a minimum of 40 hours/week on something I'm forced to do and be told what to do, well, everyone who offers me such a thing can get lost.

I just want to watch YouTube all day, travel, and try new foods for FREE, and I'm not willing to give anything in return. As I wrote, 10+ years of therapy couldn't change my outlook on life, and I never let any professional do so. I want to play video games, create art (YouTube videos that no one watches or video game streaming), and laugh at internet memes. All of this without sacrificing 40 hours a week on something burdensome. I just want to enjoy being alive. Honestly, I can't imagine or find a job where I wouldn't want to kill myself after a week.

Self-sustainability is out of the question because it’s a full-day job. The hippie/homeless life in Tenerife is out because I don't want to lower the comfortable life of the average person. I can still rely on my parents for a bit, but who knows how long? They have often told me that they hate me for my outlook on life and that I am just a societal burden. I don't have the stomach for a SugarMommy/Daddy. I couldn't make a living from art. I have neither the face, persistence, creativity, nor talent, and I would only do art for 5-10 hours a week at most."

This morning, I was especially looking rough and I had a virtual meeting with my 2 bosses so I told them my cat ate my camera wire to do the meeting just in audio. One of them told me to use my phone instead, so instantly I knew I was fucked. I usually put on a ton of makeup and all, but that time, it was obvious that something was off.

In the meantime, my bf went out to get some dope so when he came back, the camera wad pointing at the door and I’m not sure if they saw him but I told them hold on and put the phone down. I told my bf to go to the balcony and went back to the meeting, but for some reason he opened the door to get back inside and I had to put my phone down again. It was just all very weird. 

At the end of the meeting, one of my boss asked the other to just stay the 2 of them, and I’m pretty sure they talked about me looking messed up or me trying to hide my bf. 

It’s the same thing for my building. I live in a fancy place and since we’re back together a week ago, I got a call from management telling me they can’t kick him out but he’s making other residents uncomfortable and that my reputation was on the line. 

It’s really hard to be an addict while keeping a job, but when I’m sober I have panic attacks so bad that I quit jobs on a whim during an attack multiple times. I’ve had the same job for 1 year which is a miracle, but honestly it’s because I’ve been on meth. 

I wish I didn’t care about what people think of me and him but unfortunately I do. Everyone now knows probably I’m an addict and I’m so ashamed. "

I've already worked 2 days this week, if I call in sick tomorrow for a few days, will I still get 5 days worth of sick pay? I plan on being gone until next week.

I had a few days off and now back at work and feeling so dissociated like I don’t care. I know I need to care because I have bills and cannot afford to not work. I know time off is supposed to be rejuvenating supposedly but I’m coming back feeling more antiwork especially this time around. I have a chronic illness and it’s been so hard to have the energy to work all the damn time.

How does anyone in this sub manage dissociation. The break wasn’t even long, I had the 4th/5th off because we were closed and now I’m back feeling lost and worried that I’m not performing and that someone will notice.

I never feel like I’m good at my job and it’s a difficult role. Thinking of working until I’m old is so depressing but I know it’s necessary in this state of capitalism. I don’t have generational wealth to fall back on like some people who are just able to not work for a while, and just feeling defeated. 

I’m thankful to have enough to pay my bills when working, including income from my partner who also contributes, but I’m just feeling so lost. "

I wrote and edited all kinds of content for them in the time I was there. I liked the work, but we were all treated horribly by our management, so I quit. Since I left, they have just milked the projects I had left in progress to make it look like they were doing new things. They recently released a “new and improved” website and it was clearly written by a bad generative AI tool that clearly used my old content as an input. It is terrible. They have not even reviewed it and there are glaring errors and repetition. 

Beyond the content, none of the links work, nothing is backdated, so articles and events from 2018 are showing up as news.

I wouldn’t call the website I did for them perfect since I was juggling the work of 6 roles at the time, but it was functional and accurate….they probably just did a new one to make it look like they were doing something. 

I don’t work there anymore, I don’t own the work I did for them as an employee, so they have every right to set fire to everything I created for them despite it being a terrible idea, but wow. Not sure if I should laugh or cry. On one hand, it puts it out there publicly how incompetent they are when they drive away their good employees and try to take shortcuts. It shows AI is no replacement for people who know what they’re doing (or even those who kind of know). On the other hand, it makes me not want to put the work I did for them on my résumé in case someone thinks I’m responsible for that calamity. Not to mention seeing my work chewed up and spit up by AI is downright insulting. It might not be, but it feels personal. "

Hired me under false pretenses of how the code is. Just in general a abusive and manipulative POS. I've had other reddit posts about this place. Its rotten from the top-down, I offended an HR lady 3 months in; In that conversation, I was trying to ask about my health insurance because I am sick . and she was trying to quiz me on the companies 4 values, she got really offended and complained about me to leadership and got me Pipped. There was no substance to this PIP so I got off immediately.

That was over a year ago, I don't have bad performance, I deliver on time.  
We recently had an offsite that I had enjoyed going to. I thought my manager was a bit weird, walking the younger girls to their rooms, spending alot of time talking to them . And I saw him put his arms around the waist of one of attractive recruiter during happy hour. Just overall sus behavior for someone that is over 50 with a wife and kid.

The week after my boss started to refer to the pip again - and started acting really hostile and aggressive. A few days later I get fired, in that meeting was him and the HR lady I offended. There was a look of pleasure on their faces, it made me feel very weird. The level of malice that they had, they could have fired me if they wanted to before the offsite. And they waited until after just to make it more personal.

That really struck me as evil, I've had shitty bosses before but something about him just seemed really off... I look him up and lo and behold. His mugshot pops up under the sex offender registry for unlawful deeds with a minor.

After the initial shock, I am just dumbfounded that leadership put someone like that in a manager role in a company that is majority women. Everything that I had perceived of him that I thought was 'off' now has another layer of sinister about it. The thing that really makes me sick is that his is protected, I've talked to employment lawyers about this, whether this constitutes a hostile/dangeours work environment. And since I haven't gotten sexually harassed he is safe. And in the state of California, a person cannot lost their job for being a registered sex offender

This guy really messed with my career and dumped me into a really bad job market.

I don't know what the lesson here is:  
Always look up your manager on google I suppose, you cant count on your company to do a background check

In April, that team was gutted when layoffs hit.  I was told that it was a financial/business decision that the company was making and was not performance based.

Three days later someone from the company reached out to me because I do a lot of video work on the side.  The company’s annual all hands meeting was coming up and one of the executives decided on a whim that they wanted a video of a fun skit to break up the monotony.  

The deliverable was a video less than 15mins in duration that would be shown only once to an internal audience.  Their budget was half of my annual salary, and I was paid well. 

I loved working for that company.  I loved the values, the team, my manager…. I would have scrubbed toilets if they asked me to.  But to get laid off due to the bad decisions of executives while they kept their jobs AND continued to burn money….  There are no words for how disillusioned and disposable I feel as a human being….

But there are many extremely hard-working people who are suffering to increase their income. Many of them are raising children, for which there is a limited window in order to have them. As as result, this children grow up without much money or access to great education, and they continue the cycle. 

The main things people need to improve their circumstances in this economy are opportunity, education, skills, and experience. So if government money is going towards anything, why not that?

**Opportunity**: The government invests a higher percentage of GDP in R&D for new tech, tech which many companies actually spend very little despite what they argue in the media. While companies are great at applying existing technologies, they depend on government-funded research to create new tech that can then be tested and applied towards marketable products. With just a percentage or two higher spending, profitable markets can be created the same way the internet, the tech that is in smartphones, and others have been the foundations for billions of profits for companies such as Apple and Alphabet. This is one way to grow the economy rather than merely chop it up and divide it in ""fairer"" ways.

**Education**: Children have a higher capacity for learning than adults do. That's why they should have better education from the start, all the way through high school. With better education, especially for those with lower income, families can make income gains in just one generation rather than over multiple for low-income families. This would especially make a difference for single-parent families in crime-ridden areas, where joining a gang and engaging in criminal activity is a way to survive rather than merely a bad choice. By paying for these kids to attend a boarding school, for example, they are off the streets and their parents don't have to spend precious dollars on childcare. The children are put on a path to higher learning that results in them making a living wage in adulthood, pulling out of poverty and avoiding crime and its probable legal sanctions.

**Skills**: Adults would also have access to skills-growth education that allows them to quickly shift to new careers. Companies would benefit from this as they would find more quality candidates and have more incentive to shift focus rather than dragging their feet and, in the case of monopolies, limiting the growth of certain sectors merely to avoid the cost of implementing new tech and products that could face growing pains. Children and teens would also get skills included with their education. That way they could get a job outside of high school if necessary.

**Experience**: Part of educating people would be at least one year of applied learning and training. Two would be better so that the student gets a balanced exposure to different career paths and job types. Imagine how many kids would work harder if they had to work a retail or labour intensive job for a year and found out what was waiting for them after graduation? Also, this kind of training program would provide low-cost labour to companies, helping them offset costs and the higher taxes that help pay for all these programs. 

Now, I don't know a lot about what I'm talking about. Clearly, the poor need more than just education. They need healthy food, solid transportation, safe living accommodations, mental health programs, etc. The problem is that, while the economy is still great for the wealthy, it doesn't work all that well for the poor. It just doesn't make sense to pay for everything a poor person needs. But making them figure it out by themselves while also gaming the system against them makes little sense either, and it also leads to the kind of cultural fragmentation and social problems that conservatives are always complaining about. The sensible thing is to identify what the government CAN pay for that would help the poor become more productive and make more money for the effort they already expend. That way, work is no longer a backbreaking and relatively futile endeavor, and parents can watch their children's opportunity grow rather than recede.

I make an “awesome” hourly pay, my boss and coworkers are “awesome”, I have an “awesome” pension plan, and I am completely fucking miserable. Every. Day. 

All aspects of my jobs really are great, I’m not trying to be sarcastic. When people hear about my job they tell me how lucky I am and how they wished they could have a career like I do. My job challenges me, and comes with some added stress during our peak seasons, but for the most part it’s pretty relaxed and my boss is very supportive of a work life balance. I have hobbies outside of work, paid vacation time, all of it.

So why am I so miserable every day going into work? It’s to the point that I go home after my work day and just want to lay in bed and cry. I have zero motivation to take care of myself, upkeep my home, spend time with my partner, or do any of my hobbies because I feel completely mentally drained after my day. The company I work for has people who have been here 30+ years, and I just can’t imagine coming into the building everyday for the next 30 years and doing this job. I feel like I can’t vent to any of my friends and family about it, because they just keep telling me it’s a great job and I’m lucky to have it. 

Is it the job? Is it me? Is it just the existential crisis of realizing that I don’t have a choice and have to work somewhere doing something for the rest of my life and hope I get a few good retirement years on my pension before I die?

There is an interesting thing about human behavior, and it is that everyone is aware of the passive aggressive nature of the exchange of goods and services.

Your perceived value will never be matched by the one buying what you offer, and this is the thing... your effort may very well be valuable, even more than what you sell it for... but the aim of our current system is different.

The aim is not to prosper as a whole in the exchange... the aim is for one side to have a net gain, the zero sum game that it has become, turns it into a mere desire for one side to be humiliated, the humiliation for you to collect what is owed to you... to beg... even if what you charge is pennies, in fact the lesser you charge, the greater the gain in not repaying you, the greater the begging, the humiliation.

I agree, people not paying while delivering the service may be their fault, so I decided to tell clients what I charge for my services up front.... and be very determinant about it... and here is where the real culprit appears:

People are more likely to let themselves be charged (some may say ""scammed"") by a ""peer"" or an ""ideal figure"", by someone they would like to ""be"" or ""aspire to be"", rather than by someone they consider ""bellow"" themselves.

So, even if you go with the price up front, If the buyer perceives you as being bellow themselves, you'll never get any clients... ever.

Doesn't matter your approach: assertive, passive, neutral, humble... it doesn't matter.

This is why rich people would rather hire expensive services managed by other mouth breathers that delegate the hard stuff to underpaid labor.

But if this same labor ever manages to build something on their own volition... then the buyer will begin to find it very alluring to not pay for it.

This goes beyond race or nationality, but still related to it, it just so happens that generational wealth, even across races, create a specific ""look"".

So instead of paying some university for a piece of cardboard... maybe it would be a better fit for your career, maybe even an investment, even if your work doesn't depend on looks, even if you are a man (maybe even more if you are a man...), to get a good plastic surgery, and to work on your bullshitting wine conversations."

Starting from being on ""salary"" but also required to work no LESS than 50 hrs per week, same ""salary"" being changed 10x+ over the years *(one time was for asking to not receive work calls on the weekend. I just work in the office, and a vendor does not NEED a check first thing on a Saturday morning)*, being the only salary employee who's lunch did NOT count towards their time, etc.

Anyways..... Fast forward to recently. I was requested to work with OPs manager *(he just told me the info, I made the documentation)* on making a list of our customers, their projects, and how many serviceable sites we have for each project. I called this ""Project Projections"".

I made it first with everything we currently have, and all the upcoming work we've been told we will be receiving. When I told her this is what we had and I'd be sending it soon, she said she did not want that, only the work we CURRENTLY have. 

Okay, I took off the upcoming and sent it to her. Then she called to the OPs manager and was upset that the upcoming information was missing (don't know why she didn't tell me....). I sent it again. How I had originally had it. Didn't hear anything

.... Until a week later. She randomly called me and went over some stuff about the website and personal things she has going on. Then starts telling me about this document again. Now, she wants an estimate of when the upcoming is going to be happening. She also wants to change the document name to ""Project Roster Forecast"". I told her I can change the name to whatever she likes in just a matter of a second, just to let me know what she would like it named. She then starts going on and on about how ""Projection"" doesn't even fit what the document is about, etc. I politely let her know that's just the name I came up with while making the document, and again can change it to whatever name she think suits it best. Then she says..... ""I don't know what forecast has to do with anything, it doesn't ring a bell."" and to name it ""Projects Projected""...... The OG document name I had was ""Project Projections"", but yeah go ahead and waste 10 minutes actively trying to pick an argument with me over a file name, that neither of us care about. And she will also never search for this file either. Any time she needs it, I (or someone that will tell me to do it) will get a phone call to email a copy lol.

When this convo happened last week, she told me that since this document in particular is not getting to her with the information she needs and she's been having to pull teeth to get this done when she asked for it years ago *(was asked for less than a month ago because they were having a meeting with someone about selling business. but yes, apparently ""we"" are YEARS behind on this very, very simple 3 column excel document.)*, she would be making it HERSELF and to go hands off on this project. Whatdoyaknow, she just called my office manager this afternoon telling her to tell me to send the document and that she's been having to pull teeth to get anything done on this. (the same copy I sent this afternoon is the same one I sent the 2nd time after re-adding upcoming work, like 2 weeks ago)

But I'm not doing my job apparently. FFS."

I've been job hunting like crazy. I've landed a bunch of interviews only to be ghosted.  Had an in person interview today - HR was singing my praises during the hour long phone interview the other day.  Sounds like I have it right? Got an email 2 hours before the in person interview that they are changing direction and will not be pursuing my candidacy. 

I'm tired. I'm so defeated. I feel like an absolute loser and I really don't know what to do anymore. I hate that a job has such an immense hold on my self confidence. This is not what I thought my life would be. 

Please tell me I'm not alone. "
8,2024-07-08,Can I ask for a clause in my new employment contract not to be fired without cause and also no salary cuts?,u/thekingdombum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dyinsv/can_i_ask_for_a_clause_in_my_new_employment/,antiwork,"I posted here before about potentially taking a job at a company with some bad glassdoor reviews (probably like 10 out of 80 say something about salary being cut and being laid off in the last decade, and some weird political dynamics with the president bringing in some old friends to work for him). 

The job itself seems good with decent salary and benefits, but I was thinking of asking them to add two clauses: 1) you can't fire me without just cause, and 2) you can't cut my salary without my consent. Thinking about adding a severance pay clause too. I'm not sure if others have done this, but I'm not going to move across the country with my family only to get my salary cut by the big man.

I don't know how this plays out with being laid off, since it's not the same as being fired, but suggestions on any of this would be great. If I take this job, I want my ass covered as much as possible."

12,2024-07-08,I feel like I've lost all ability to cater to people's egos,u/WeStanPlankton,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dyjgy1/i_feel_like_ive_lost_all_ability_to_cater_to/,antiwork,"So I lost my job recently, and some of these feelings I was already dealing with, but I feel like this really set it off for me. I hate every job. It's not what I want to do with my life. I used to be so good at being ""on hand and available"" just a blank unit eager to please. I tried to climb the ladder, but no matter what I did, no matter how friendly I got with higher ups, I got passed over. I always tried to work my butt off, to be a team player, and I don't know if I made myself too convenient or maybe it's just been years on the delulu train and I'm actually terrible, but my performance reviews are very consistently positive, I've never not gotten raises and performance bonuses. But something about me is just not attractive enough, no matter what I do, to convince higher-ups to let me join the club.

My goal has always been to focus on what I love. I love writing, I've recently gotten into painting, I love art and it's been so good for my soul. My English degree has actually been really useful, like a lot more than I ever thought it would. I have a lot of office production assistant experience in the film industry, but it was so toxic and I hated 12+ hour work days and then the strikes happened so I transitioned into the legal field for a few years. Everything in film dried up and it's still pretty dead, industry-wise. But I don't want to work in production ever again. I want to be a writer, so that's been my focus in this current unemployment phase. I really really hope this can help me churn out some work I love and hopefully get me closer to getting an agent or getting someone to buy a script. It's a pipe dream, but whatever, it's what I want and a definitely have the time.

But it feels right too. I don't have to talk to anyone if I don't want to. I can sleep in. I'm telling myself to set a goal each day, it doesn't have to be a lot but set a goal, and I've been doing it! I love it and it makes me feel a little less anxious because I feel that much closer to achieving it as a career option. But with my last job and now, it's like I've totally lost the ability to be that blank person that happily does what I'm told. Like I'll do what I'm told, that's not the issue. I like being a team player. I like being cooperative and supportive of my friends and coworkers. But as I've prioritized my mental health, I've lost all ability to tolerate ego and abuse. I don't pick fights, I will try to excuse myself or I will withdraw in conversation, I will try to keep things light and just remove myself as best I can without issue. But when tempers flare, I don't fold like I used to. I just disengage or give them as little of myself as I can, and it's so shocking the reactions this has caused.

Idk, I feel so worn out from work, like work as a whole. I never liked catering to egos, but my ability to filter myself in order to placate them has fallen apart. I need a job, so I'm looking and I know I can force myself to filter or alter myself in order to pay my bills, but it's just so degrading! I just wanna stay home and write stuff.

And I know it's ironic or whatever that I'm saying this after losing my job, but me losing my job was a really messed up situation.  Basically, a mountain of drama spanning two and a half years, also the company is in some financial troubles, I unintentionally caused a fight that got really inappropriate and personal, I stood my ground, got fired. The moral of this post still stands, I am so tired of having to be delicate with the egos of my coworkers and superiors when everyone else gets to behave however they want.

  
TLDR; I've been thinking a lot about my career since getting fired recently, and I'm just so sick of catering to the egos, the sensibilities, the biases, blah blah blah in the workplace. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I work or how ""on hand and available"" I make myself, no matter how friendly I get, no matter my certifications or qualifications, no one high up has any interest in letting me join the manager/exec club. I don't wanna do it anymore."
6,2024-07-08,Sterling Background check - But I lied about one job. ,u/Low-Quirky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dyjisx/sterling_background_check_but_i_lied_about_one_job/,antiwork,"I'm unsure how to get out of this one. 

Out of the 4 employments listed, the oldest one is a company my friend's father owns that she said I could put on the resume to get my foot in the door. 
They've verified all but that one, which I listed as NO CONTACT. 

Now, the reason I did this was partially fear. If they didn't contact my friend or the reference I put down, and went around and contacted the number on the website, it would have rang her father—who doesn't know about what his daughter did for me. So I didn't chance it, as I didn't want to get her in trouble. I said no contact, and said ""no documentation to provide,"" and haven't heard anything in regards to that since. But I'm worried this one job is going to plummet me. 

For that job, I was listed as an independent contractor. When you look up the job on Google, it says ""permanently closed"" even though they're not. 

If HR at this company asks about this job and why it couldn't be verified, what do you suggest I do? I'm desperate to leave my current job as my boss is an actual nightmare and I'm underpaid. I'm also currently working in the field I'm applying for, so I have the skills to back it up. 

Any advice? Fake a 1099? Cry?"

I wasn’t given a reason, I smashed performance records since joining, met every single target and then some. Every week since I started I go over my performance with my superiors so I know that I was doing so great.

All I got was “the company needs don’t align blah blah”.

First job I’ve felt proud of - First job I’ve ever truly loved and it’s gone like a light switch.

I’m not even upset with myself, as I know I didn’t do anything wrong, I’m just in shock that this has happened.

First time I’ve ever been let go from any job, I haven’t even ever had a disciplinary meeting in any previous job since I entered the tech world in 2015.

The pay was decent and I enjoy the type of work they wanted done. I was told I would have 30-50 tickets a month, so I would have steady work.  Well, here I am, four weeks later, no work yet. 

I did my due diligence. I looked up the company and it had both positive and negative reviews going back 10+ years, so I am 99.9% sure the job is not a scam. I have been keeping an eye on my credit report and my bank accounts, no suspicious activity.  I have sent several emails and they take days to reply, if they reply at all, and I haven't gotten a good excuse as to why I am not working. The unfortunate fact is that IT jobs around where I live are hard to come by and I enjoy the type of work I was ""hired"" to perform. I want this job, but my patience is starting to run short.

I am familiar with the concept of promissory estoppel, but I haven't really suffered any loss. The agreement for pay was per job, so nothing was steady. I don't really even have a ""lost wages"" claim because I haven't had any other offers in this time. Any suggestions on how to either make them get their head out of their butt, or if they have done anything reportable if I decide to burn that bridge?"

After i told them i quit the chief manager stop addressing me at the office,he doesn't even tell me good morning anymore ...

I asked for a day off (the company must pay me at least 10 days because i hadn't taken them) and when i asked for one day-permission they told me no and that i should finish the handover and there isn't enough time to take a day off.

Also the other day the team manager yelled at me in front of everyone at the office for a petty reason...and we have a shouting match(something that has never happened before with me at the office)

Its crystal clear that they try to push me and retaliate because i quit in the middle of the summer and they are panicking due to heavy workload...

I literally can't stand up going to the office for two more weeks ..should i send an e mail and tell them that i will quit sooner?
Or just don't show up next week and take a sick leave?
How should i handle this? 

Ps.I don't like to fight especially now that i am leaving but I don't want to be taken advantage as well, they clearly didn't appreciate the 3 weeks notice,

I’ll admit, I haven’t worked in recruitment specifically but have been involved in the hiring process. I genuinely have not seen what people are alleging. That’s not to say I didn’t see loads of other shady shit - I did. Just not that. 

Well, not after today. If anyone is actually hiring, I’d be shocked. We’re being gaslit, not just by the companies, but by those currently in power.

4,2024-07-09,Friend is being completely taken advantage of by his employer and it's ruining his life,u/613toes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dytfjm/friend_is_being_completely_taken_advantage_of_by/,antiwork,"He works as a pool technician and everything was going smooth until last year when he switched from hourly pay to a yearly salary. The terms in his contract are 40H/week Mon-Fri but his hours quickly escalated to 10+ per day Mon-Sat. I've seen his tracking app with my own eyes and he's documented with hitting 60H+ on a weekly basis. Even when he's off the clock, there's a constant stream of work related calls coming in from the boss + other staff. 

Despite this, he has not gotten paid for a single minute of overtime. He was oblivious to the fact that overtime for salaried employees was even a concept and it seems his boss convinced him what he's doing is completely normal. He pulled out chatgpt when I pointed this out and he was floored. The boss/owner (same person) has instilled a culture where this is expected of workers and everyone must buy in. 

Example 1: A Tech made a mistake during installation and the pool started overflowing during the evening. Boss called and asked him to go back Saturday to fix it but the worker refused as his contract states he doesn't work weekends. After hearing this, the owner lost his mind as was apparently more pissed about the employee refusing the extra work than the potential 10k$ in damages.

Example 2: A new hire called off his first week of work because he was very sick. The boss was livid he didn't grind through it.

Example 3: Sunday 6pm, me and the friend just finished a round of golf and are about to go back out for a quick 9 holes. He gets a text from the boss telling him to do invoices, points at the text and says *gotta work* then leaves. 

Apparently the owner has stated his dream in life is to have 5+ companies that all run themselves. He's very active on LinkedIn but it's 100% about his 9-5 job as a manager in a different industry but makes zero mention of the pool company he's an owner of. It's a little bit shady.

Despite all this, my friend said it's not really a concern and 100% worth it for a few more years because his boss will do right by him down the road. This job is slowly killing him and he's the only one that doesn't seem to realize. His social life went from super active to non existent because he's always working or tired. He's gained a ton of weight despite being a competitive athlete not long ago. He went from dating regularly to two years with zero action. He goes through multiple energy drinks during the work day and crashes like crazy in the evening. We once got together at a friend's after work and he started dozing off. He graduated college but is no longer interested in his field of study and has said numerous times he wants to work his entire career for this pool company. He's clearly unable to say no and is very easily pushed around. 

Insult to injury: The boss is ""friends"" with his parents and he's got the mom taking care of his kids every day (for free) + the dad working part time for the company as he ""wants to stay busy in retirement"".

Our circle of friends is concerned but nobody has said anything major yet. It there anything we can do as friends to help? He's a great guy at heart and it's sad to watch unfold. Located in Ontario (Canada) by the way."

2,2024-07-09,Unsure if this is a Wrongful Termination claim.,u/Borg184,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dyuxpe/unsure_if_this_is_a_wrongful_termination_claim/,antiwork,"Looking for an opinion on this. As it is a legal matter, I know none of this is legal advice, but still. I'm unsure if I have a leg to stand on. It's gonna be a long post, but I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.

Some background.

I have worked in a Grocery Store (Publix) for the past 10 years. For the last ~4ish years of that, I've been a Customer Service Staff. The guy who sits at the front desk and handles returns, lotto, cigarettes, western unions... that sorta thing.

I have gotten along very well with all of my managers and other employees. There's been some friction points, but it's largely been a mutually beneficial relationship. It hasn't been great, but it's worked out well enough for my needs.

Last year, I noticed an anomaly with raises. Namely, the entire way that raises were handled was changed, basically under everyone's noses. In essence, the entire system was changed so that pay scale raises and actual raises happened at the same time, without taking one another into account, thus perpetually pushing everyone to the bottom of any given pay scale on a long enough time period. I was, needless to say, not a fan of it, and I raised hell about it. I went to my manager, the store manager, and even up the corporate ladder. I didn't get anywhere, but I made my voice remarkably well known, and I know several others did as well.

Nothing happened. A year passed, and we were rapidly approaching raise time again this year. Suddenly, I am terminated, in a job that is *remarkably* hard to get terminated from (you essentially only really get fired from Publix if you openly speak out against a customer, damage Publix's image in some way, or willingly steal from them).

The reason listed on the termination paper is Insubordination. I'll offer some context here.

We have had a notoriously difficult customer shop here for a while. He is a sincere pain to deal with, and if you try actually going through the entirety of the Publix policy with him, you will be there for hours arguing about it. I'm usually the one stuck dealing with him, as I am usually the closing person on most nights that he comes in.

Eventually I got to know the guy well enough to know that he wasn't *lying* to me, he was just being a hardass on things. I came to eventually shortcut the process just to get him out of the store as fast as possible so I could get on with my life. I cut corners, I will fully admit.

However, in doing so, I told every single manager I was in frequent contact with (both of my direct managers, both store managers, and several other managers from other departments) what I was doing, who I was doing it for, and I essentially begged them to please step up and deal with the customer as my authority in the situation was outweighed by theirs. Nothing ever happened. I continued to take my shortcut about things to improve my own life. This continued for... easily the last 2-3 years.

Nothing I was doing was illegal, it was simply against Publix's usual policy, something that you come to realize is frequently bent on a whim to deal with customers like him.

Fast forward to June. I come to realize that Publix is almost undoubtedly going to be up to their old pay games. I have a significantly larger lead on the situation this time around, so I prepare. I begin talking to many employees, quite openly, and even handing out cards, which lead to a website I created explaining the entire pay situation in depth, in an attempt to educate and organize people to fight back against it. It wasn't an attempt at forming a union (even if I do outline the benefits of such on the website, and hold a poll to gauge people's interest), but it was a federally protected activity, discussing wages with other employees.

I have no doubt that these cards and this site eventually made its way to the managers of the store, and likely even off to corporate. I knew it was a possibility when I started handing out the cards, and I even put a small section of the website dedicated directly to both the managers and corporate, speaking directly to them in a polite, professional manner. Nothing on the site could directly identify me, but it wouldn't be hard to figure out who made it, based on some simple context clues.

Fast forward to last week. I am on break, when a manager enters the break room. The problem customer had been in early today, and I dealt with him in the usual manner. The manager and I talked about him as we normally do. I once again reiterated that my hands are kind of tied in dealing with him, and that I would very much appreciate managers doing something about it.

Nothing much comes of it, as normal.

Fast forward to today. I am suddenly called into the managers office, and let go on grounds of insubordination, claiming that I have been refusing to follow Publix's policies, and have told a manager that I have no intent to do so. (I may have said so at the time, but if it was done, it was done in jest, as I know the manager in question well, and I speak to him in such a manner quite frequently. I sincerely do not remember what exactly I said, that's how inconsequential the discussion was.)

Now, I'm certainly not a legal expert, and I already have some emails out to some lawyers, but this screams retaliation to me. I have openly explained what I am doing for a customer to several managers. Nothing happens for an upwards of several years. I begin to organize people about unfair pay practices, and suddenly I am let go for this reason, despite having received no verbal or written warnings, counseling statements, or other forms of punishment for this exact same activity for several years now.

I'm not exactly broken up about the job. I could appeal it, but I really don't want to. I was intending to leave come evaluation time later in the month anyway, so honestly, it all works out, even if it now sends me back into the job market. But I'm still curious if you would consider this wrongful termination or not.

(tl;dr:
Take shortcuts to deal with annoying customer.
Openly admit to multiple managers the shortcuts I am taking, ask them to deal with the customer so I can stop doing so.
Nothing happens for 2-3 years.
I begin to educate and organize people about the company's unfair pay practices.
I get fired for doing the same thing for the same customer I have been doing for years now, with no warnings, write-ups, or otherwise, in a company that is remarkably hard to get fired from.)"

Next she has “feedback.” Well, I had cleared an outline first to make sure these kinds of “feedback” didn’t come back. Apparently reading is hard? It has nothing to do my with work quality and entirely her changing her damn mind all the time.

And once again, I have to work on a hurry because of waiting on her to respond.

And don’t tell me it’s because she is so busy. She logs on at 9 and leaves at 4 and takes an hour lunch break. She works less than everyone else. She doesn’t even participate in major initiatives anymore. 

I’m so tired of having management like this in my career. Corporate america is so full of asshole leaders. "

35,2024-07-09,My Coworker (M56) was extremely insensitive to me having a panic attack. He can now enjoy me having a 3 week sick leave. ,u/Salzfisch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dz0dif/my_coworker_m56_was_extremely_insensitive_to_me/,antiwork,"So this week on monday morning, around 5 am or so, I had a panic attack due to mental health and stress from wrok. It lasted about 20 minutes but it took a massive toll on my mental. early in the morning at about 6:10am I managed to message him I need a day off. (Don't worry, I do therapy and have been for a year or so and as for the day off, I intentionally left 5 of my 30 vacation-days for such cases)

Here's his response to that message: 

>A panic attack isn’t nice but it passes quickly, is not life threatening and many people have them, they are well treated with medicine and therapy. I know what I am talking about. As harsh as it sounds but waiting at home for it to get better brings absolutely nothing. What do you want to wait or hope for? Your surroundings at home are only contributing to your misfortune. Panic attacks last only a short moment. Every 3rd person has an occasional panic attack. Back in my day I went to work to have something to distract me, helped me a lot. You need medicine, sport and you need to reduce your communication with friends on the pc. You need friends and therapy in person, maybe even group talks with people. 

>Change all that and it’ll get lighter and easier. Staying home from work definitely won’t help. Think about if you want to come back to work tomorrow.

I have talked to a plenty of my friends and even my doc about this and all collective agree that whatever he's pulling is extremely insnsitive, manipulative or even abusive to an extend.

He is correct that I should do more sports, but that is about all he's correct about.

I had this written out to him in an Email so that he can not screw with it and twist it against me.

>I think I've mentioned before, if not several times, that I have problems with depression and anxiety; as well as problems with my brain's genetic inability to process stress and emotions properly (suspicioun of autism). The panic attack **comes from work**, as well as the depression and anxiety I struggle with.

>I'm not going to listen to the ""fewer PC people and more real people"" nonsense anymore, because it's simply not true. Isolating myself from the only people who understand me will only make things worse for me in the end.

>The reason I do phone/online therapy is because the wait time for in-person therapy is netween 4 to 8 months or longer and the distance I would have to travel would be more than 1 hour one way. 

>And the way I describe my home to you is nowhere near as bad as you ultimately want me to believe. Yes, there are moments that get me down, but ultimately my parents and siblings have my back and I have theirs. You're trying to tell me that the only place where I can feel safe is apparently not safe after all.

>I also doubt that you really want to have a contructive conversation. I've already told you several times that my concentration problems aren't because I'm sloppy, but because my brain isn't working properly. Instead of constructively suggesting a conversation, you took the toddler route and started with ""Oh, you'll forget that anyway.""

>

>Ultimately, I can no longer trust you to tell me how I'm really feeling.  
I hate to say it, but **you** are the main source of my stress at work.  
You can find the doc's notice in the attachments.

I'm 25, I work full time and am making around 15% more than minimum wage (not in the US). When I got my first paycheck, I told my parents how much I earned and my father said it was ""everso slightly more"" than what he earned at the very end of his career. It got me thinking.

My family lived on a single income, my father's one. He did not graduate from high school. He did not even go to high since he has never graduated from middle school. And with his ""low-skilled"" job (I don't like this expression but how else can we say it?) he managed to afford :

- a 80m² house on a 1.5km² land

- multiple cars (constantly one more than family members we had), granted it was never new or high quality cars, but always cars that would actually start and run.

- 2 RV's!! These are so much expensive now!!

- a few dogs and cats at all time (with the obligatory food that comes with owning pets)

- 3 kids with my mom + had to pay child support for another child he got before

- He would smoke a pack daily and go to bars regularly.

- A 20m3 swimming pool that he would empty and fill up every single year, with the obvious additionnal expenses that a swimming pools comes with!

  
On the other hand, with the salary I got now, I'm forced to live with my parents again (I do feel pretty lucky as they are super chill with it and are actually very happy that I get to hang out with them as much as I do)

I checked around the place we live and the salary I have is theoretically not enough to rent the LEAST expensive appartment around here (which is much more than a third of my income) . Yeah you read that right, it's not like I could be picky or ""I don't want to share a room"" no, the least expensive one is above my means. I make enough money to live on the street (in my car? Oh wait, I can't, I go to work on a bicycle because cars are so expensive now). Hope I can save up enough money so I can actually get out of this situation, but it's rough. I can't imagine how it is for people who don't get support from their families.

  
(Just to clarify, I don't have anything against my parents. The title is more about ""the last generation"" than just my parents, but since I've wanted to only talk about my special case, I phrased it this way) Love you mom & dad"

I’ll contact you and tell you if you need to come into the office.”

What happened on Monday was that I got notifications from the time card app that all but one of my shifts (my only shift now is on Thursday) were removed and put up on the “open shift” list. From here on out, I work one shift. One shift and a one hour “house meeting” on Friday morning. No one contacted me. 

I work in healthcare, and though I have not yet been approved to accrue PTO, my supervisor approved it.

Anyways, on to the story!

Where I work is currently changing software so as a result we are in training using an online class offered by the software company. Each section is broken down into smaller 15-20 minute modules the longest being 35 minutes. Apparently I'm completing them too fast and making our head teller look bad to the CEO. Monday through Wednesday we are rarely busy. So after being told to take the tests instead of playing on my phone to pass the time I agreed. My other coworker and I are around the same spot for completetion so far. I was the only one reprimanded by the head teller because after a vacation I did 4 tests in one day to catch up.

Although our head teller is usually a bit more busy she will spend 15 to 20 minutes a day watching America's got talent videos on Facebook and showing them to another coworker. 

Aka, enough time to get a module in. She barely does any transactions and honestly passes it to me when her and the other coworker will bs instead of getting her drawer balanced and teller stuff up and running as she comes in later than us.

I was reprimanded for many stupid reasons but being too good at an easy thing is a new one. Had a good laugh. Just another thing on my list of why I intend to leave as soon as possible. My husband is at a stable job or I would move to a different place to find something better. We can't afford to live on just his salary or I wouldn't be here."

But they apparently also had a job in finance & control, so the interview was for that one as that would be a better match. Especially given some technical qualities i had that they wanted. 

So i had the interview, and the interviewer asked if he could still make me happy with the order picker job if i wasn't hired for the finance & control one. I said yes.

Now about a month later, i contacted them angrily, as they couldn't be bothered to send me a rejection email or have a 2 minute phonecall. They claim they closed my application with them and thus also sent me an email. 

But they fucking didn't, cause i don't have a fucking mail from them. 

So, now i told them to send me proof of the mail if they are so sure about sending one. Hint; i'm probably being ghosted just like after my interview, cause they replied very soon twice and now they don't. 

Bunch of dipshits, ghosting applicants when they took the effort to come to your office, but when they contact you you can just claim you 'sent' an mail. 

They didn't even want me for the order picker job, which can be done by literal 12 year olds, cause of ""working hours and travel"". Sounds like those are problems for me if any, not for you. I fucking live 15km away. Go eat shit"

The long term plan has always been for myself to take over his position once he retires, both of us plan for this to be the case. 
The difference between the two of us is, he gets paid to be a manager, and I get paid the amount of someone who is not a manager. 
Things are escalated to management once I’ve done all that I can, and he essentially redoes everything I’ve already done to solidify the fact we’ve done everything. 
My complaint, is that he loves to flick things back down to me to finish off after they’ve already been escalated to him. After they’ve been escalated to management, the customer no longer wants to hear from someone that isn’t management. 
In my eyes he simply doesn’t feel like dealing with it and because he’s able to, he makes it my problem to deal with, again. 
I can justify this with the perspective of him knowing I’m capable and “prepping me”, but on the other hand it’s quite irritating feeling as if he just doesn’t want to deal with it and is giving it back to me when I should be done with that customer and carrying on with the others I have to deal with. 
Am I wrong?
 I know he’s allowed* to do this as the manager, but is it not logical to finish it off once it’s been escalated to you? I can’t imagine as the manager I would flick these things back down to the person in my current seat to finish off. He also did the job I’m doing now prior to becoming the manager of the department. 
I’m just looking for outside opinions.. it irritates me to the point of feeling the need to call him out on it.

I am a 36-year-old who last completed classes in the year of 2007 to 2009 at LaGuardia Community College. I’ve been living in Europe for most of the time don’t ask why and essentially I have realised that my ability to get a job has been greatly affected by my lack of finishing college. So essentially I have 51 Credits from LaGuardia, Community College in New York State. The credits are in Liberal Arts- Humanities My fear is A) Since it has been so long, will any other schools except my credits towards a degree program? I was specifically looking at Social Work and/or Psychology. As nearly every personality/job test I do recommends I go into one of these fields. B) Do I need to head back to New York State or can I go to another state I was thinking of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or Chicago Illinois and the main reason being I don’t have a drivers license, also seems like I could get a job in either city. C) is it worth going back at all and any other old bastards like myself that went down this path and are better off? D) While I am not against seeking a trade, I fear a lot of comorbidities namely high blood pressure and early coronary artery disease may make any of these less likely. I'm surely not as spry as I once was, and on top of that I'm crap at math.

Main fear here is whether 10 year+ credits will even transfer. For trades main fear is that I am too old to be an apprentice. I've heard some guys say this doesn't matter, but have heard firsthand that ageism is definitely a thing and younger guys will have an easier time finding an older apprentice. Not to mention if I get hurt or have a cardiovascular issue, I'm back to square one. For those wondering why I don't stay in Europe, the pay is crap here. And yes I AM A US CITIZEN, actually a dual citizen. Id love to stay here but I can't even get a basic interview.

How did I get this way? Years of pissing around and smoking pot and generalised anxiety. I've dropped the pot for over 6 months now and reality has hit me like a semi truck.

I work for a small company, as a result, things like Paternity leave just don't exist. We are 50 people, if someone is out, we really feel that pain. I get it, I really do. My state has FMLA protections in place and have to offer me my job back if I leave for up to 12 weeks, but they don't have to pay me, my wife has the same deal. She at least qualifies for Short Term Disability for part of the time she is out, but it's 60% pay for 6 weeks, which still hurts.


I took 2 weeks off when my child was born. I used my accrued PTO balance, which pretty much wiped me out for the year. Additionally while I was out I worked about 15 hours the second week to handle some critical tasks, so didn't even really take the full second week off. One of the owners also called me repeatedly while I was out, I screened all of his calls because I was in the hospital with my wife and child. Ultimately I didn't pick up any work from him, but it just annoyed me that he couldn't leave me alone for even a few days. Also when I got back, he immediately blasted me for being behind on something, which really annoyed me because he fired the original person who was supposed to do that task and now I have been doing it for 6 months, but no one else is trained to work on it. I'm sorry the bi-weekly task fell behind when I was out for two weeks.


Additionally I spent the first week of my leave in the hospital due to some complications. That meant I really only had one week at home with my new baby, which was not ideal. Also my wife had some complications from surgery and some pretty rough post partum. She is really struggling with my return to work, and frankly I would also like to stay home with my child.


There really isn't a point to this post, I don't have a good answer for anything, but paternity is a joke.

If it’s not the right place for this story, please let me know and thanks in advance for reading my rant, ahaha*


My boss has this habit (habitual!) of texting me to come in early and giving me very little warning, sometimes 10mins before he wants me to start. I also have an end time, but I came to quickly realize that an end time (to him) is a concept that he has yet to master. 99% of the time, I can’t leave at the scheduled end time because they are between an hour to two hours late. 
But, as a tale as old as time, I wanted the money and had to fight to get those hours, so I just put up with it. 

Anyways, they just redid the schedule because of summer and they cut my hours from 20-23hr a week down to 12, after he promised he wouldn’t cut my hours. I knew my hours would be cut, but I thought it would be more like 15hrs, not 12 (which is means I lost between 8-11hrs). 
But, I also knew that he wouldn’t stick to the schedule, he never does. 

I knew he would call me in on my days off, because with the change in schedule I now only work 2 days instead of 4, and he is very dependent on me. The new schedule wasn’t even two days old before he just disregarded it. As predicted, I ended up coming in on my new days off, plus coming in early and working longer on the day I was scheduled.
 
But yesterday took the cake for me. I was suppose to work 6hrs (as per the new schedule) and ended up being there for 11hrs straight, no breaks, and having my whole morning and evening taken as I was there from 10am-9pm. I left and was like, yeah, I’m done. You want to cut my hours and change my schedule, then let’s do it. 

Today is my day off. I’m very happy because after the 11hrs yesterday and having a young son, I’m tired.
But I knew what was coming, because it always happens and I was ready.

9:30am, just sat down after dropping son off at camp, drinking my coffee, chilling, I get the text. He told, not asked!, me to come in at 10am…on my day off. Uh, no!

For the first time, I said no. I told him I can’t, but that he should call the girl, who is scheduled today, to come in early. He just texts back thanks.

And from now on, if it is my day off it will always be no. No reason, no excuse. Just no. 
I guess it’s a little bit of malicious compliance, because for me I’m just following what the schedule says.

Maybe he will learn to not constantly fuck over the person who has gone above and beyond for them, who runs the store so they can have a life, who has never called in sick, who picks up the slack and all the balls that they constantly and consistently drop.

I was very annoyed with my hours being cut, but I accepted it and now they need to accept that I’m not a servant who is at their beck and call. "

Back in the 1970s companies regularly provided chairs for stationary positions. Even in a lot of ads from the 60s the workers were sitting in a store. Sometime in the early 80s, when unions started to decline, managers started to take away the chairs. At the restaurant my rep worked in at the time when somebody got injured or unable to carry the trays the person would be moved to cashier and sit during their shift. When they moved to standing it pushed a lot of older workers out. 

The companies claimed it's not professional but they're sitting at their desk while making this claim. For anybody too young to remember they gaslighted us, but the real reason we don't have chairs is because they want to push out the older workers and disabled workers. "

I’ve worked for them for 13 years, and full time for the last 4 years. When I came on full time, I was absolute bottom of the barrel and happy to be there. Then through a series of (un)fortunate events, (one genuinely amazing guy passed away suddenly, three other also really amazing guys decided to part ways and start their own company) I have found myself the lead guy for my region. 

I’ve always been pro-union, leftist kind of ideology, so in this role I’ve found myself in I’ve tried really hard to advocate for the guys who work for me. They’re all fairly new, some new to the field entirely, and so I’ve tried to teach them, show them how it’s done, make life better for them than it was for me when I was learning (less middle of the night emergencies that I would have to wake them up and get them out of bed for, advocating for raises for them, giving them time off when they need it for almost anything, no-questions-asked-I-don’t-care-you-asked-me-for-the-time-so-take-the-time-i-don’t-need-details kind of stuff). 

And I’ve tried to learn a lot from this community and other leftist communities about how best to advocate for workers and how to give these guys what they need. Because not only is that fair in my eyes and right, but also I’m a believer in a happy worker who has their needs met is a productive worker who wants to get the job done. 

But these guys absolutely push me to the limit and I don’t know what to do anymore. I think a lot of it is the lack of rules and repercussions at this company. Like I said, small, family owned, there was never a need for those things because the bosses son sure as shit wasn’t going to bad mouth him. But now we’ve got essentially outsiders working for us, and there’s nothing to hold them accountable. I don’t want to have to hold them accountable, I want them to either want to be here or be able to have a conversation with me that something isn’t working out for them, or they need support at work to deal with issues at home. That sort of thing. 

I feel like I’ve said all that to them, time and time again. If you need me I’m here for you, just let me know what I can do to help, sure take a couple days that’s no problem, yeah you can start late I know you’ve got a lot going on. 

But now I have one who isn’t drinking on the job but drinks when he’s on call, which means I won’t send him out on an emergency, with no other repercussions. I’ve got one kid who starts late ALL the time (we have a soft start time of 8-8:30am, and that starts when you get in your work truck in your driveway, not driving to some destination or to our office or anything) yet he consistently starts at 10-10:30. I have had many gentle conversations with him about how we should try to start on time, how we need to do this for everyone otherwise we leave other people hanging, how it’s our busiest time and we need all hands on deck, and he’s been receptive. But today he started later than ever and I, for personal reasons in my own life, just lost my shit on him. I didn’t cuss him out but I told him this was unacceptable and that he needed to start on time from now on because it’s gone on long enough. 

He basically flipped me off via text. 

I want to be better, I want to make sure I’m handling these situations right and in a way that is right for them while also getting the job done. Truthfully I don’t want this role, but I’m in it and I’m trying to make the best of it.

I humbly beseech thee for any and all wisdom thou might bestow upon me.

Boss wants me to work immediately ,u/brain-in-meat-vessel,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dz6f2s/tore_my_ballsack_open_boss_wants_me_to_work/,antiwork,"I won’t get into too much detail but while helping a friend with some stuff in his backyard on an evening after work I fell on top off a chain link fence and some wire poking up sliced my ballsack open as well as some deep cuts on my leg. Went to emergency and got 6 stitches to hold my ball back in. 

As you would imagine, it didn’t feel too good and actually impaired my ability to walk for the weekend. The cut is super gnarly and at high risk of infection, which has me taking tonnes of antibiotics. Here’s the thing: I work as a lifeguard, which means I am at a pool and baking in the sun all day. Even the possibility of hopping in the pool and getting pool water on my balls could infect them and make them go necrotic. 

However, my boss first issued me No-Pay Sick Time (which is weird since I have 80 hours of sick pay currently). Luckily, I called some higher-ups on the city registry and got that swiftly changed. She also got the ability claims specialist to send me a form of which I need to get signed ASAP so they can return me to work. This form will cost me $80 out of pocket to get signed (that’s minimum, I checked all the doctors in town). As soon as I get this form signed, they will try to return me to work with a slight adjustment (I won’t be teaching swimming lessons since the doctor note said I can’t be in water for a week minimum). 

Except, I don’t even want to risk it. I don’t want to stand in the sun, literally have my balls soaked in sweat because let’s be real, they will, and have the risk or possibility of jumping into the water to save someone and thus, getting my balls wet (not the good way). 

So what’s the move here? Canadian btw, municipal government job. I genuinely wish I could send my boss a picture of my testicle hanging out of my bloody ballsack so she could get some slight semblance of the type of injury I have. The doctors note is vague stating “deep laceration” and I didn’t feel like telling my boss that my balls got torn open.

I’m not sure of the formalities of this sub nor the typical 9-5 stuff pertaining to work-related injuries as this isn’t something popular in my life.

Went to the hospital and got X-ray’s and thankfully no fracture. Got a medical excuse that got me some time to recover from it for 2 days. For those two days, I wasn’t working. Just breathing exercises and practicing arm movement as to not get sore or stiff all the time. Listening to doctor’s recommendations and whatnot. Return to work, business as usual. This morning, however, my RM calls me in regards to my two days off and tells me I’m to use my sick time to cover those days, to get paid?? I told him I didn’t care about missing the two days of payment, or even tapping into my rather low sick hours for such a thing. I further told him that unless I’m legally supposed to, I didn’t see why I needed to. He told me he’d call me back. I’m going back to my morning tasks. With that: Good morning. :)

I had to wait two months for the start date because i asked if there would be appropriate training for the job and an onboarding process. They said theyd need those two months to set stuff up. Okay great. So i started 2 months after i got the job. Pay was lower than anticipated for the role but that was okay. Role included more home working. 

The role was environmental consultancy after being in industry. Man consulting is garbage and id never go back. The pay was below what i was on in industry too. It was a senior role, but id never done consulting before and they hired me knowing i didnt have the experience (they said that too). There was no training on how to do my job. Id make mistakes and there was no time allocated on projects for this either considering i was new. 30 working days in i had a review where they said id been there two months now and had nothing positive to say. When i contacted people for help they were useless. I kept trying to improve but wasn't fast enough and couldn't meet their targets. And the more mistakes i made the worse it got so i made more mistakes. They had no useful advice other than keep asking for advice which i did and got nothing useful. Had weekly meetings with boss who was unhelpful. At one point she was unhappy with the way i wrote emails so i was using chat gtp to rewrite what i wanted to say and they loved it. Never had someone question my emails in 6 years of working there. 

Anyway on Monday I got told (4 months in now according to their HR system - explain that when end of march was apparently 2 months go figure 🙄) that i needed to attend a probation meeting because i wasnt meeting the targets and the out come could be that i get fired. So i handed my notice in. 

Boss just passed it to hr to deal with. No call. Nothing. Just telling me they agree my leaving date and will arrange a courier to collect my laptop the day after my last day. 

What a waste of time. The only positive is i built my savings back up and i have a job interview for a role in the public sector where i worked before and im gonna be bold and ask for a 4 day week. Cos my anxiety cant take a 5 day week. 

Im so done with working now. I tried to meet their stupid targets.

The good news, is my little photography business that i run because i love it in my spare time is going to have a busy couple of weekends and ill have the time to process the photos and prep for my interview next week.

Wild animals exist in a constant Malthusian struggle to survive. “To ask why some societies in the world are still poor is the wrong question,” writes the economics blogger Noah Smith. “Poverty is the default condition.” Poverty — a shortage of resources — is humanity’s greatest and oldest enemy, and the interesting question is how so many of us have escaped it, not why some of us have not.

The wonder of the world is that in rich countries, “almost all of us manage to stay a few steps out of reach of that monster for our entire lives.” That is the product, Smith argues on Noahpinion, of industrial modernity, “our single weapon against the elemental foe.” When people denounce economic growth, “they are denouncing the very walls of the fortress that has allowed them to live more than an animal existence” — although that growth must be sustainable. “If we burn the walls of our fortress to throw a party in the moment, there will be nothing left to protect our descendants, and the foe will devour them.”

3,2024-07-09,"Trapped in a job with a 'nice' boss. No breaks, no future, and no other options",u/Blargenth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dz8qmy/trapped_in_a_job_with_a_nice_boss_no_breaks_no/,antiwork,"So this is gonna be a long one. I moved to a small town to be closer to family and spent a year and a half unemployed because no one wanted to hire me (probably due to me stupidly listing my last boss who fired me as a contact...) until finally a cellphone repair shop eagerly (and desperately) reached out to hire me after I dropped off a resume.

Let me say, this place has horrible employee retention. The place is a corporate franchise, but the company is so bad at connecting with their franchisees that its more like a mom-and-pop shop. We get no assistance what soever from corporate, we choose whether we actually want to take jobs or not that the website lists that we do, and all they do is take royalties out every month.

The boss is great! He's compassionate and kind. When I got hired he asked if I needed any help with bills since I had been unemployed for so long, and always talks about being willing to work with people when they are having issues.

But the guy can't hold onto money or make a good financial decision to save his life. We keep iPhone screens and parts in stock but nothing else. So when someone comes in with an android phone. We either 'special order it' or just tell them we don't work on it (usually sending away cheap A series phones, Chinese knockoff phones and Motorola phones). So he takes in huge bits of cash to special order these parts, and immediately uses it to pay rent, bills, royalties or if I'm lucky, us. This means that these people will pay for their parts, and then we have to turn around and lie to them saying ""We couldn't get the part in"" or some other bs excuse like that. Making them mad and turning their ire towards me when its the owners fault.

I'm currently two weeks behind on my pay check, and it looks like it will be a choice of paying me, or ordering parts this week because we are over $700 in parts in our order cart, and he keeps saying ""Oh this account is in the red"" or ""Oh I have to pay that."" 

Ont op of this, we are now only just me in the store. I've seen two employees leave now. The one I was hired to work alongside who was great at talking to people. And the second one who was a druggy, but at least too some work load off my shoulders. On top of this, I am the only employee, so I've been dubbed 'manager' by default. And I hate it! I have to deal with irate customers, I have to make up lies for why our parts aren't in, I have to tell people why our dumb policies are the way they are, and I have to deal with every customer face to face. I started as a technician because I wanted to stay in the back and barely deal with anyone!

I'm stuck, if I quit two things will happen. I will go back to being unemployed for probably a long period, because no one wants someone who doesn't have any solid references, and struggle to keep my self afloat month to month. And two, this guy who is just trying to keep a company afloat will go under because the last employee of his store just left.

  
I really just want some rest. I love this job and the work I do. I just wish I didn't have to deal with customers as much. I wish I had someone alongside me to help offload all the work we do and to hang with when we have tons of downtime. I'd love to make more money (we are salaried and I barely make 2200 a month), and to be paid more consistently. And I'd really love to move into a career where I do what I do! I fix phones, I fix laptops, I troubleshoot and fix PCs, I replace laptop screens, I microsolder new hdmi's onto consoles and dabble in microsoldering other parts on big circuit boards. I can fix almost anything when it comes to a phone, tablet, PC, laptop. And I've done call center support for desktops too (though I'd really rather not go back into that)

  
Any advice, encouragement.... just anything to get me through this week would be nice."

A few of my non-negotiables:

* Whatever the recommended living wage is for my area
* Full benefits (health, PTO, childcare, etc.)
* 4 day work weeks (32 hours paid at 40)
* General things about wear what you want within reason, use your phone or do school if it’s dead inside, etc.
* Yearly bonuses, yearly raises to adjust for inflation, plus performance based raises
* Don’t require doctors notes and if I do, I pay any copays for those visits 
* Assistance with transportation if needed
* Maternity, paternity, familial, medical, bereavement, all 100% paid and for as long as needed (or up to a set time, EG: two months bereavement)"

6,2024-07-09,Alternative lifestyle : solutions and possibilities,u/Ignite_m,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dz9paa/alternative_lifestyle_solutions_and_possibilities/,antiwork,"After researching through some subreddit, I noticed the fact they weren’t many posts on alternatives lifes options, and it puzzle me someone bc I see so many lost people, wanting to escape this conventional life. 
We don’t have many sharing of relatively unconventional lifestyle. 
I do however see quite a lot of people, being back to a slower life, to country side mainly. It’s one way of doing even if it’s more difficult that it can seem. More and more people begin to do their own garden, even if it’s mean to spend hours every days to do so.
This lifestyle seem to be the most popular and visible.
But even so, it seem that most of the people who are willing to escape the rat race or our so called capitalist system, think that we just cannot.
Idk for every country, and I am in a privileged position for sure, but I think that there are more solutions than appears.

So I wanted to ask if you know some ways of living alternatively, because we need to share this types of information. Somehow, it might give hopes so I think it’s important.

For my cases, it’s important to note that I live in France, so idk if there is this types of places in others country, and what kind of life we could live if we wanted too.

What I can share personally, is what I experienced and what can be possible.
First of all, I guess that many who are sick of this world, may need a complete turn over and therefore a break without a plan of returning in our ancient life.
I know that some people have some big responsibilities like childrens or family to substain. In those case, yeah, it can be more difficult to do the big jump.
I can also say that peoples with closeness to nature tendencies, and a taste for simplier life will be more easily prone to find themselves again with these little adventure.
After doing the big jump myself, I met many peoples who were doing seasonal jobs, and for the rest of years wandered around. 
I can particularly emphasise WOOFING where you are hosted, and share meals with your hosts in exchange of 4-5 hours of work a day in a farm/nature oriented job. It’s profoundly more human than typical jobs and you can learn a lot of from it. Many does that with a specific project in mind and gain knowledge and skills from it. So it can be your thing if you especially like everything farm oriented, or you have building project.
In France we also have many « ecolieux », it’s basically community living with an ecological mindset. There is some where you can go to visit and maybe if you really like it, considering living there on a mutual agreement.
For those who live in city and don’t want to drop everything, you can find many association and community garden, that can be a great start.
In woofing and in those ecolieux, you can experiment living off grid and see if it’s your things, some really have the « cottagecore » kind of vibes for those who might be interested. Obviously, you can met many farmers who can share theirs journeys with you, as craftmen, herbalist etc. I know that the art of « artisanat » are more rooted in France but I think it’s quite the same in others European country, in the US, it may be more difficult. 


For those who want to be more on the activist side, they may be interesting festivals in your country, where are hosted conferences, workshop, round table discussion etc. It can really give you a sense of purpose and not feeling doomed nor useless for a greater society.
I was under the impression that many peoples here were willing to make things change but didn’t do actions toward that. Imo, that can be very great ways to start, and you will at least feel less alone.
Obviously there is association, more local or global like Extinction Rebellion, or you can join unions too.
In France, we also have ZAD (« Zone à Défendre » which mean « Zone to Defend »), where you basically « can » lived while you are protesting again the creation of more artificial construction like an airport, highway etc. It’s a very particular way of living but if you can endure it, it can be amazing.
In those gatherings and places, you can met all kind of person who live alternative lifestyles as well. If you are an hippie kind of person, or nomad style with some artistic/spiritual side, you will find many peoples like you there.

Voilà !
I really wanted to share what I know about these alternatives lifestyle, hoping that some can see that others paths are possible. If you know others ways or want to share your personal journey, I will read everything with great pleasure and I think it can help others as well.

PS: sorry for all the writing mistake, and I don’t usually write long a** essay like that."

Working in a company doing shift management and short term staffing (stuff like sick calls over next few days). We also have another lady who is doing long term staffing (offering open shifts for the upcoming 6-week rotation well in advance).

Finally, we have a 2nd lady who does our staff's time cards. Said lady is leaving and someone has to now do time cards. It's looking like they are going to ask the long-term scheduling lady to take over time cards, and ask me (and my coworker who also does what I do) to take on the long-term scheduling part.

Not that I particularly mind helping with that, but I do want to be compensated for what is effectively extra work being added. What's the best way to go about stating that when this is to be discussed?
For some added context, I am also on a contract til November so not sure if that effects anything but I do think they are unlikely to just fire me on the spot if they don't like what I say due to rather needing someone doing what I do and already being somewhat short staffed.

I'm also in Canada, though advice from abroad still helpful."

I’m working a terrible customer service role to get by right now with how bad the job market is. Every 6 months mid level management realizes that there’s a problem with payroll bloat. Instead of cutting back on stupid things or just laying people off, they try to get rid of us another way.  Their strategy is to change everything around in a day, they move the goal post for our KPIs way past anything that is humanly possible, they put all hands on deck for supervisors to harass/micromanage employees, they point fingers, punch down, play the blame game, and most of all they give out correction action like it’s candy….The result of this is a sickeningnly toxic environment. Employees (including me) end up breaking down from the stress. It’s horrible. Once the payroll bloat goes away from everyone leaving, they swap everything back to business as usual and then have the people who stayed on deal with the brunt of the work.

This sort of hostility isn’t by any means new, but I’m seeing it be more and more common amongst employers who desperately need to cut down. They won’t even touch layoffs, they’ll just bully everyone out of the workplace.

I’m not even sure if contractor and independent contractor are two different things, so again, apologies.

 I read that you should be classified as an employee if your employer provides you with tools to do your job, if they set your schedule, tell you how to do your job, etc. this is where I feel it might be a grey area for me, because of the work I do I handle surgical specimens so there’s a certain “way” I have to do it that they tell me. I’m also provided the station I work at with the blades, tools, computer, etc. They also tell me when to come into work next. They also hold me overtime sometimes and tell me when I can be done for the day. I tried asking for more hours a week but they said not right now because I still have more to learn. 

Reading about the taxes IC have scares me because I’m new to all of this and am clueless and don’t want to owe more money than I would have to at a “normal job”.

It was my dream job. At first it was exciting and very fulfilling. Everyone had a ""grind"" sort of mindset, but we worked with honor and took pride in what we did, and shared the wisdom we gathered through experience. We felt valued, appreciated, and well-compensated. It was amazing.

Then, a bit over 2 years in, 49% of the company was sold to a private equity firm. And things became noticeably downright *awful* There were no more company-wide parties, raises didn't keep up with inflation, more demands from higher-ups, and worst of all - *everyone* became extremely jaded. Employee turnover skyrocketed. There was no more pride in our work. ""Just do the best you can"" became the mindset, while we were given targets that were impossible to achieve without sacrificing our mental health, and significant personal time.

And then covid hit. The president of this company stubbornly refused to acknowledge the pandemic at all, and refused to provide us any masks, while we employees were forced to continue working in operating rooms without any PPE provided by the company at all. The president had the gall to cite CDC masking recommendations, (which were for normal everyday people, not operating room/hospital personnel) as an excuse to continue working as though nothing had changed.

They fired me for raising concerns about the company putting us in blatant danger, and not following OSHA regulations about providing adequate PPE. This company became unrecognizable compared to when I was initially hired. It was devastating in a lot of ways.

My question is: what are the telltale signs you look for, when a company has become a private equity hellscape that starts to treat their employees like downright trash? More importantly, what's the best way to warn other applicants to stay away too?"

I mentioned race, body-size, and nationality because of the relevance I think it plays in this asinine statement our boss made. The boss was constantly pestering my coworker to “eat a hamburger” and, despite working in a heavily populated area of non-English speakers, would call the customers “dumb” for not speaking perfect English. FYI the boss only spoke one language. 

Months later, the boss got the coworker laid off for “not having enough hours to schedule her” despite never giving anyone their requested vacation time due to “being severely understaffed”.

Also, the boss eventually was fired for saying something racist to a customer’s face.

Lately they've been cracking down on Overtime in a way that feels vaguely illegal. 

At the beginning of the week they told us how much OT we each had a crewed on the payperiod thus far, and told us we had to cut it by either taking a longer lunch(our are unpaid) or leaving early by the number of minutes(or otherwise) we are over. 

This feels like it shouldn't be legal? We accumulated this OT fairly, and OS shorting our hours on it, even through these methods sounds like time card fraud.

Simon Kuznets declared in 1934 that “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income”

Kuznets developed GDP as a means of measuring the impact of the great depression. It enabled governments to track any increase or decrease in their nation’s wealth as represented by the value of goods and services produced, and became increasingly important as governments estimated the cost of waging the second world war..

It was intended to monitor the Depression and war time economies. Not be the all purpose measuring stick for all economic activities and human welfare/

It’s funny how people now worship GDP and treat it as the most important thing when it's own creator said ""no it's not""

I told him I hadn't slept And couldn't keep anything down and that I really wouldn't be able to run around like crazy all night in a restaurant whose a/c wasn't even working properly. All he said to me was ""I need xyz tonight it’s gonna be a busy night” then about 30 min later he followed that up with "" Make sure you come in tonight” and didn't address what I said whatsoever lol

For context, I live in a European country, so things are a bit different then USA.

I had my fare share of horrible bosses, from ones that underpaid me, underpaying is an understatement, I'm talking 50€/month for 494⁴h/week. One that was an ex marine, that chalanged me to a fight. To others that never paid me until e threatened legal action.

But this is about my current, boss. 
I work in IT for an MSP, and my boss is great.

We have the 22 mandatory vacation days +1 for the birthday, company policy.

Free coffee.

Personal Health insurance, that is not mandatory in my country, only company wide accident and work related health issues.

If I need to go to the doctor, either for me or anyone from my family, I don't need any doctor's note, compensate for the time, or reduction in the paycheck.

Anual Christmas party with gifts for employees and their kids, no mugs or cheap stuff. Last time I got an amazon echo dot, and my kid a remote car. Plus a summer fun day, with food drinks, karting, paintball, etc

He listens to his employees, and for more than once he was my crying shoulder on a really poor phase of my life, an offered some extra time off for me to recover.

About the work environment, is mainly relaxed, were we are free to do as I please as long as the work is done. Also I'm free to do projects as I please, that may help the company in any way, either by bringing new business, or improving the way things are done.

And most important, the pay, it's more than fair, it's above average for were I live.
No extra hours payed, but I rarely do them and if we need to go to a customer we get an extra for lunch and dinner, that is more than enough for 2 people to eat.

So guys, don't lose hope, there are still some great bosses around there, they are just really hard to find."

I have never heard of this being a policy companies can have, and never worked for a company who’s used it before this.

This companies point system is as follows:
-if you’re more than 5 minutes late = 1 point 
-if you clock in more than 5 minutes before your start time = 1 point 
-if you clock out more than 5 minutes after the end of your shift = 1 point 
-if you leave early, regardless of how close to closing time = 1 point 
-if you call in sick = 1 point
-if you call out for any reason (emergency, transportation issues, mental health reasons) = 1 point 
-clock in more than 5 minutes before and/or after your lunch break ends = 1 point 
-no call no show = 3 points 

3 points - verbal warning
5 points - written warning
7 points - final warning
9 points - termination 

My boss assured me he would be lenient with this during my first 90 days and as long as I contacted him and communicated if I’d be running late or need to leave early, he’d work with me. He told me last week I had zero points and was extremely satisfied with my performance when I asked if he had any constructive criticism. So all seems well right?

This afternoon, I notified him that I have a fever of 103 and do not feel well enough to come in tomorrow (picked up a bad cold from the family over the holiday weekend). Additionally expressing my concern of getting everyone else sick or hurting myself or others. I work full time in a warehouse and lift thousands of pounds of furniture and other goods under extreme heat each shift. 

His response stated that this would be my third point… (will update yall on that when I see him in person and get record of exactly how those points magically appeared??). 

But I’m growing increasingly frustrated at how a system like this makes sense for them as a company or the employees. I get the approach of them wanting to discourage calling out and abusing time off, but this feels excessive. They complain about turnover rates constantly, now I know why.

I feel like I should go ahead and save myself the trouble and just find another job now. "

2,2024-07-09,somebody please advise,u/No-Risk-6859,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dzgnwu/somebody_please_advise/,antiwork,"I really don't even know where to begin. So I was laid off in December. It took me months to find another position, I was getting nothing. Finally, I got something. A small local family owned company was expanding their sales team, and I applied and I got the job. I've been working for them for a month. 

Here's where the trouble comes in. I am the very first outside sales rep this company has ever had. Their daughter in law does all of the sales, she attends appointments, goes to trade shows, so maybe she is the first outside sales representative but she has hired me to work under her. and I am the very first person this company has hired for outside sales. 

  
I have been there one month. My boss has worked with me maybe for 30 minutes in total. other than that she is typing away at her computer, right next to me, or taking phone calls or doing really anything but not explaining to me what she's doing. She has spent maybe 30 minutes working and training me. She showed me how to use the software they use and that is pretty much it. When I wanted more help on product knowledge, she told me to go to the companies YouTube page. So I did that. IT WAS A COMMERCIAL. WITH LITERALLY 0 WORDS. how is that supposed to help me learn the product at all? so then, she gave me a little 5 problem assignment in order to figure out how to pick out a product for a customer. it helped. I asked for more. I had to ask her 3 times to give me another worksheet like that. she still has given me nothing. 

  
like I said she doesn't work with me or train me on literally anything, she's radio silent. On my first week, she pulled me aside and asked me if things were going ok so far because she wasn't able to gauge my interest because she'd noted that I had headphones in a lot and that I was yawning. that I was yawning. so now I am afraid to yawn. I do not yawn at work. I indulge in yawns on my lunch break. As for the headphones, never was it stipulated that headphones were not allowed, in fact I saw the other 4 office employees all using headphones so I thought it was acceptable. I just like tuning into my work and listening to music and zoning in, but I guess that isn't allowed. She said that she wants me to listen in on peoples phone calls and conversations so that I can learn better. I have a major hearing deficiency and hearing 1/2 of a convo where the person isn't facing me is doing nothing. I hear gibberish coming from their mouths. but yeah that'll help me figure out how to do this job. 

  
she encourages me to spend time in the warehouse, again to understand the product better. Which is fine. Maybe I agree a little bit. but how is me sitting in the warehouse sorting bolts and nuts helping me understand the product any better.........

  
I'm really pissy about this job because it is NOT outside sales by any stretch of the imagination. It is 100% completely inside sales. The main tasks that I've been doing since starting are as follows:

- I was given a massive account list. my job was to comb through that, email the contact for each account, and ask if they need anything. 

- once that was completed, my next task was to go through all of the emails I sent, see who didn't respond, then find a new contact for each 

- once I completed that, my next task was to organize the salesforce account list and weed out any outliers. 

  
I was quite thrown aback when about a week ago, she told me at around 11 that she was leaving to get visit a customer but she'll be back. did you not think to bring me? You didn't think to bring your new outside sales rep? You didn't think to train them a little bit on something they'll have to do? 

  
I am so frustrated because she has shown such little interest in training me or getting me anywhere. she hasn't made a plan for me. She has given me zero training materials. I'm on my own then I get chewed out for using headphones and yawning. Now I find myself dreading work everyday because I sit and stare at a screen and fulfill myself with busy work. I HATE HATE HATE staring at the screen. I hate working in the office 40 hours a week. that. is. why. I. chose. a. job. that. is. outside. sales. I like getting up and leaving to my appointments and visiting with customers. I like seeing people face to face. this is so not the job that I accepted. I don't know what to do. 

  
On top of this, they have severe payroll issues and for the first 3 weeks they didn't pay me on pay day. Then they gave me a lump payment, only to be not paid once again the following pay day. 

We had a 1:1 last week where I got to ask questions and shit, she told me she was gonna work closely with me to do some phone calls and emails (two things I already starting doing on my own) but that was the extent of her laying out any training plan for me. No idea on when it is I get to find customers of my own to visit, on when I can make cold calls, on when I can attend trade shows. 

I can't stress enough how little work I have to do. I have nothing to do. I email these customers, sure, but do you think it takes 40 hours a week? I have to dilly dally and make myself appear busy by writing shit down in my notebook and looking studious. or by wasting time counting nuts in the warehouse. do I leave? what do I do?!!?!?!?!?! can someone tell me what's going on?! I need clarity so bad and so far my family has told me to find a way to make it work. 

  
I'm also just riddled with anxiety and dread about this job. I feel like at any moment I'm gonna be fired and they'll say something like it's just not a right fit. And that the reason they're not bothering giving me anything of substance or laying out a concrete plan for me is because they're going to fire me so why should it matter what I do.

**I know this is a positive story but it sounds like you guys need it**

I work at a small hotel with a staff of about 10 people. Honestly, my job situation is pretty great, and I wanted to share a positive story here because I think we all need to hear more of them.

First off, my boss is amazing. He’s really supportive and always has our backs. The housekeeping and front desk managers are fantastic, and we all get along really well. It feels like a tight-knit family, which is rare in a work environment.

What I appreciate most about my boss is his commitment to supporting us, even when things get tough. If there's an issue with a customer, he'll fire the customer rather than let us deal with unnecessary stress. He genuinely believes in backing up his staff, which is incredibly reassuring.

Recently, I made a small mistake at work and started freaking out and crying. When I went to see my boss about it, he was so calm and understanding. He told me to prioritize my mental health and to call him if I ever need anything. It made such a difference knowing that he cared more about my well-being than the mistake.

I know not everyone has this kind of work environment, but I hope sharing this can bring a bit of positivity to your day. There are good bosses out there who truly value and support their employees. Always leave a bad work environment if it makes you miserable."

A big part of my job is to support the board. On my first day of interacting with board members (as well as never having taken minutes before, mind you) I was sexually harrassed in a committee meeting with four BMs (50-70Fs), the Director (50F) and myself. I was told to stop takibg notes as they had an off record talk. The lead forgot to tell me start taking notes again, so another BM chimed in and said ""You gotta turn him on XXX!"" And all the women started laughing like teenagers, repeating it ""Go on, turn him on! Hahaha!"" As one of two males working at this business, I felt belittled, humiliated, and powerless.

Fast forward about six months. The same BM who made that commebt has repeatedly made trashy comments, snide remarks, amd outright insults to me. So much thst after she said I lacked ""professional judgment"" that I broke. I'm angry. I went to HR to file a complaint.

During my meeting with HR, I wanted to know that if I filed this complaint that I would be protected from retaliation because I can see that happening very easily with this person. HR said ""we will give everyone a fair chance to air their concerns"" and that while I wouldnt be fired for making the complaint, I ""could be let go for any other violation.""

That’s all.
 
Office work and attendance are relics of a Tayloristic approach to work. This outdated model values control and supervision over efficiency and results. 

They say people at the start of their careers learn faster in the office, and I’ve heard it so often it almost sounds true. But what they actually pick up are the countless, pointless quirks of office life. Nothing else.

In offices, the medium is the only message: being present is seen as almost more important than actual productivity. Think about the expectation to stay late just to show face, regardless of whether there's actual work to be done. Or the absurdity of having to look busy at your desk when you've already finished your tasks.
 
When a company claims they have a good office culture for remote capable jobs, I just read that they don't allow flexibility. And that's the only flag I see: a red one.
 
Remote work, when done right, is far superior. It saves time, money, and eliminates a lot of the unnecessary nonsense.

If there’s one thing 2019 taught us, it’s to never repeat it again."

This is a semi vent but also seeking advice. I’ve been a paralegal for nearly 10 years and yes it is a stressful job where sometimes not enough credit is given. I recently joined a law firm about a year ago and the work load has been heavy and unrealistic. I’m constantly putting out fires.

Half the staff was fired in the last 6 months including a senior attorney. I have been designated to do all their work.

I have only taken 2 days off work once in April because I became extremely ill and was hospitalized and half a day yesterday because I had to go to the hospital for treatment.

I told him if this isn’t an emergency he really should call another time because I’m in a HOSPITAL…

On Monday I moved 1.5 hours away from the city center because I could no longer afford rent the salary for the role is also pretty low/ below industry standard.

However, my manager has been landed with the shit until the actual maternity cover starts and asked me to help her. As things have dwindled down in my other temporary role that I was originally employed in (long story but also not my permanent job) I agreed to help her and took it as a chance to learn something new. 

However, these last few days she has made a few comments to me which have for lack of better words made me feel a bit shit and incompetent. This job is all new to me and she is actually only learning the job herself but as she is my superior of course I’m relying on her to direct me. However, these last few days she has said a few things that has made me feel like she expects me to know what I’m doing or just go ahead and wing things as she is which I’m not comfortable to do. We work in healthcare, albeit an admin role, but I’m not going to wing it when the service I’m currently working for actually just had 3 year enquiry over the work of a specific consultant. 

I’ve literally only been doing this job since last Tuesday and yesterday she was showing me a bunch of folders and said that she wants to have all these spreadsheets set up for the next month the same as last months and says “this is why I need you to do this so I can start scheduling” as if I was to already know to do this when 1 she hadn’t even asked me yet and 2 she ended up giving me literally over 2000 patient records to close on our booking system so I didn’t have time to do anything else these past few days. She made it should like I was keeping her back. I told her I would do that as soon as possible and worked on it yesterday. She then reiterated that she can deal with all the calls and everything else but she needs me to do this one thing, again as if I was just to read her mind. Never mind that she actually isn’t even taking the calls, I’m taking them all and then when I ask her advice as obviously I don’t know what I’m doing she’s asking “have you checked this, have you checked that, contact this person, contact that person” as if I shouldn’t be asking her these things and should know to direct my queries to a bunch of other people I don’t even know.

So I worked on what she asked me to do yesterday and with all the calls and what not I didn’t have time to complete so was going to work on today only to find out she has gone ahead and asked another employee who starts an hour earlier than me to do it which to me is very impatient and also takes for granted the work I had already done and has wasted my time. This also makes me feel like I’m just not quick enough or that she’s annoyed I wouldn’t come in earlier (without even being asked of course) like she does nearly everyday just do to this one thing that realistically could wait until I’m done. Then I had another query from a call I took this morning and her answer was “contact Dr such and such, she’s out go to about things like this” as if I shouldn’t be asking her. 

I know she’s probably frustrated being landed with extra work but ow does she think I feel helping out with a job that they didn’t even think I was good enough to be given in the fiery place? Tbh I’m just glad I didn’t get the job and I can go back to my old, easier job. If this is the levers of support you get it just isn’t good enough."

I’ve had ongoing, but sudden neck pain flair up for the past two months. I’ve exhausted my PTO and separate sick time I’ve accrued. All while waiting patiently for upgrades to my work area. And what improvements have been made? 


Alright, yes, my phone was moved closer to me. And I was given a headset so i can talk and type without holding a phone to my ear with my shoulder. But other than that..oh, now i have one screen to do work on. 


I had physical therapy come to my little desk area and make recommendations. they’ve been there before but not when I was employed. The recommendations were given to IT, they ordered a double screen wall mount that can move around. They got a wall mount for a single screen. Odd. Nonetheless, it didn’t work. The space is too small for it. 


So what am I supposed to do now? Is it unreasonable to ask to be transferred to another part of the hospital? A different reception area? Is asking for an ergonomic work setup asking too much?! "

it seems like econ commenters always try to say that protecting the environment would hurt the nebulous idea of the ""economy'. despite the fact that the costs of Environmental destruction would cost way more than Environmental regulation.

i hate the common parlance that a few people's jobs are worth more than the future of Earths biosphere. especially because it only seems that they care about people losing their jobs is if they work at a big corporation.

always the poor coal miners or video game developers at EA and not the Mongolian Herders, or family-owned fishing industries that environmental havoc would hurt. maybe jobs that are so precarious that the company would fire you if the company doesn't make exceptional more money every year are not worth creating/   Why is it that people put the environment against the economy?   




not to mention how fossil fuel corpos spent billions on propaganda to make people think individuals are responsible for the environment and not the huge mega corps that can spend billions on propganda we call ads  
  
  
   why do people go ""what about the coal workers"" no one seemed to care about the coal workers when they got black lung.

They told me they don't plan to bring me back in for another 10 months and requested in mean time I attend unpaid training courses. On top of this, they've also not paid me properly for a month, as my sick dates aren't right in the system, and tried to get me to request new fit notes that removed my GPs requests for occupational health or self certify so it looked like a new/different problem. 

I reached out to my line manager to negotiate a resignation, on the basis I'd focus on getting the work done so it passed and they get their funding, if they provide a good/acceptable reference based on my work and not on my health issues. Instead my line manager went with arranging a formal meeting with me and two HR reps, giving me less than 24 hours notice to contact my union rep and agree to one of their meeting times proposed. He has also requested I still complete the project work, whilst on the sick, and not getting paid (don't get sick pay on this contract), because otherwise the projects will fail.

22F. Clients cannot wait to yell at me for mistakes my BOSS makes. I work for a small company that has more clients than my boss can handle. He loves to accept jobs when he is already behind on others. 

He is also, of course, too cheap to hire help for me in the office. He does a lot of the physical labor, along with his handful of workers, while I run the entire office by myself. 

I am usually the middle man of communication between him and clients. He misses a deadline, I am the one who gets yelled at. He doesn't uphold his promises to the clients, the client gets mad at me. When I absolutely need to escalate things and have him call the clients, they are a WHOLE different person! They are so nice to him. Why do I deserve to be yelled at when I am simply relaying information from HIM. 

A few other things I hear so often that annoy me are ""oh are you the owners daughter?"" because of course a young female cant be an office manager without being related to the owner right???? 

""shouldn't you be in school?"" I graduated college.

""no offence, but is there a man I can speak to?"" sorry buddy I am the only one here.

A little tangent: I had a lady who needed services done but refused to give me her address. Said she will only give it to the owner because she is very serious about her privacy.. The owner calls her to get the address and she says ""Im sorry your secretary left it to you to get my information."" EXCUSE ME KAREN?? He of course knew she was talking nonsense. 

 Anyways thanks for reading if you did, I just needed to get this off my chest."

If they're so blatantly trying to end the system that they've stacked to benefit them, to me, this means we are moving in the right direction. Unions and taxes scare the shit out of the ones on top, exploiting our labor..
We are at a pivotal point in our country's existence. Either we get fascism or we get our stuff together and agree that this isn't the path we want..
Class war is being waged, and a large chunk of Americans are fine just bickering with their neighbors about race, guns, gender, sexual preference, abortion, woman's rights, etc - whatever the (rich-owned) Media are parroting. All the while, our freedoms are being eroded away.
When we aren't caught up in those arguments, we get hit with, ""Our votes don't matter anyway.. why even go out and vote?""
All votes matter in every election, from the national level all the way down to your local city board.
We've dropped the ball as a nation in holding our politicians accountable. 
Do you know who represents you on the county, state, and national level?
What policies did they run on and subsequently get elected for?
Did they follow through or attempt to follow through with their promises?
Did you make it known to them your approval or disapproval?
How are they voting on bills being put forth?
Did you tell them how you felt about their vote?
Why would a politician be on our side if we're not communicating to them that we are watching and hold the power to boot them from office.
Moreso, if their constituents are silent and they're being handed money from lobbyists, what do you think will happen? They'll side with the lobbyists against their constituents' best interests and take the money every time without fear of being voted out.
Democracy only works when we are vigilant to the evil that works in the shadows constantly.
The propaganda machine is live and well.
It doesn't stop, ever.
It's up to us to grab the reigns and say this isn't what we want..

UK,u/Lord_Hendrick,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1dzxgen/put_my_resignation_in_and_the_company_tried_to/,antiwork,"I work security in the UK, been working with this company for a good while and finally had enough due to unsafe working conditions and toxic work culture (They have us work alone covering the entire site and ""encourage"" us to get physical with thieves, even if there is more than one of them. We have a work group chat and the managers post gore videos of thieves being brutalised and laugh about it.) 

I put in a months notice as required by my contract and since the last week I was scheduled to work, I've had no shifts scheduled for me since, despite being on a 40 hour guaranteed contract. I didn't mind for the previously mentioned reasons and due to the fact that I already worked half of the previous month which is enough to cover my usual expenses, however I got an email today from one of the company's managers threatening to take 40 hours of pay over their lack of providing work.

During the weeks where I had no shifts I had the usual calls come through trying to ask me to cover co-workers shifts but I decided that I was going to enjoy the time they had given me off instead and stopped responding to work related contact, that is until today in which I had received this email.

For context I had stopped taking calls related to work as I usually handled these emails and communications while on the job, I am not required to be on call and there is nothing in my contract about having to answer calls or emails during my personal time and I would not be paid for any of the time spent dealing with them. I informed the company I would work as usual during the notice period in the same email as my resignation but this was disregarded and I was given no shifts since the last week I was scheduled. I received an email from this guy 2 days asking me if I was okay as I had not been answering calls lately and to get in touch as I had given a notice of resignation, I planned to reply on the single day I was scheduled this week but got this email 2 days later. We confirm our attendance for a shift by calling the company from the sites phone so they can confirm we are there.

I do not want to lose out on 40 hours pay so I decided to respond today notifying them that it would be illegal to do so, which is unfortunate as I wanted to leave on good terms as to not burn any bridges but I will not allow any employer to steal from me more than what they already do.

Tldr; I put a months notice in and stopped taking work calls during my free time, which turned out to be longer than I thought as they stopped giving me shifts on a guaranteed hour contract, they then messaged me a few days before the notice ends trying to screw me out of 40 hours pay for their own actions and I informed them that what they are trying to do is illegal."

They've made the layout of floor mentally hostile and exhausting for people working there. Its a big rectangular floor, with 6 equal sized cabins on one side and rest floor is divided in 2 columns. Each column has 7 bays, each bay allows 8 people to sit. The separation on the desk are almost non existent as they're so small we can see the person sitting opposite to us.

The whole place can accommodate 100 people barring cabins. One can see the whole floor from one end. There no such things as privacy or integrity. One cannot concentrate on work at all if there's lot of noise or distraction. The washrooms are atleast 20 meters away from our floor.

It was very evident that management wants to excercise their power and authority.

It clear what they want.
- They don't want us to talk to our teammates because if everyone talks it will create lot of noise.
- If there is heated argument between a manager and an junior dev(which we may happen as we are just humans), it will put bad impression on other managers and lessen chances of the junior to work with them, even if the person is good and just happened to get into argument for once.
- They don't want us to getup from our place as it will create distraction.
- If a team is doing fun activity they will disturb other teams, which means we cannot carry out fun activities for our teams.

I just feel like I have such a hard time working 8 hours a day for 5 days. I get exhausted, grumpy, frustrated, sick-feeling (with physical symptom) overwhelmed. It doesn’t help that I’m new here and now that I’m out of training everyone seems to be so unhelpful yet still asking for me to perform to a certain level so we can listen to my calls and see if I did well enough. 

I can’t afford to work part time. I can barely afford to take a day off. I know part of this is my mental health but I can’t afford mental healthcare even with my insurance right now because I have other things that need to be taken care of first. 

Even though this job has been one of the better ones I’ve had, I think my overall health and wellness is drowning. I’m just trying to make it through long enough to see if it all gets better.

Oh, I’m not getting hired now. Overall though there’s been so many times where I was certain I’ve landed it, only to never be contacted back. I finally got a job, and then the company decided to close down its branch in my city and fired me and the other new hires which was a massive ball of suckage.

I was applying for a job in my field with my former company from years before.   The interview started with the manager telling me about her work life balance and how having a disabled child taught her so much about life. 

Fast forward to later in the interview.   In full transparency I let them know I have a federally protected disability (diabetic),  and I would need the reasonable accommodation of needing to take an hour lunch every few months.   (This is a salary position mind you,  not hourly).  I am newly diagnosed,  so once everything is good it would be like once a year.   The hiring manger turned nasty and looked at me like something that smells horrible and advised if I'm ""...that sick you should be on FMLA, and not trying to look for a job"".  The rest of the interview went down hill from there. She made it very clear I was now disqualified. 

I tried to report to their HR but the email was set to outbound only,  same with the discrimination one.   I emailed the CEO, and surprisingly got a response.   I kept an eye on this person on linked in... their position didn't change our their employment. (So I guess that health insurance company should include ""Diabetics need not apply"" to their website.) 

But what sticks with me is this managers attention seeking behavior regarding her alleged disabled child,  but when faced with an adult with a medical condition, she immediately made it clear disabled people shouldn't be allowed to work. 

I pity what her daughter will go through knowing how she really feels (assuming she actually had one).

Amazing how fast you can go from being told your first interview was ""amazing"" and ""you are perfect"" to being ghosted because of something that would have no impact on the job,  just the managers own prejudice. "

",u/Her556223,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e03ks9/what_are_the_signs_you_were_working_in_a_toxic/,antiwork,"**Story 1:**

I'll go First the last two jobs I've worked at were both toxic.

The first job was a retail gig and what made it so toxic was everybody trying to be friends and always gossiping. The worst thing about it was my two supervisors were having sex in the back room before and after the store closes. One of the supervisors is married and matter of fact her wife used to work at the store before she left to another job. The most fucked up thing that happened was that the assistant-manager who is really cool with one of the supervisors knew about the whole thing and didn't say anything about it. Both the supervisors were guys, and the full-time supervisor was basically a drama queen who got the main manager fired and the other supervisor he was having an affair fired. He pretty much talked a lot of trash to other people used people got people fired and is still in the job. I believe he tried to become the store manager which is why he got the main manager fired.

**Story 2:**

I worked at a Community College a Part-Time Position for a department I worked as Assistant, and I would go to classes and help students take notes and proctor test whenever they had quizzes/exams or anything of the sort. Well, I got hired back in Dec of 2023. The problem was that I was originally hired back in Oct of 2023 however after getting hired I didn't hear back from HR or anybody for about 4 weeks. I tried emailing my main manager from my department and he never responded or HR. Well Apparently, this College has a high turnover rate because the day that I came to orientation the HR manager barley just started working the last person I talked to had left and a lot of people I saw were barley just starting the job a lot of people outside my department also one person in my department that was conducting the interview also had left the position.

The job was a shitshow the first five weeks of me working in this position had nothing to do with my actual position I was pretty much doing busy work and doing work for my manager. I was doing excel spreadsheets and doing inventory of all the supplies that we had in the department. I barely got any training at all I only got power point slides which isn't bad however there were certain things that I wasn't taught that I got blamed for later on down the road for not using it and I didn't even know they exist until they had mentioned it.

The environment for the college was dreadful and you can tell the employees at this college are very miserable and toxic. The Security Guards at the college are the worst they are very rude unhelpful, and they have a office right next to mines and these guys will talk so damn loudly that my office can hear them as if they're right next to them. The worst part about it is that my department was the disability office, and we would have students trying to take their exams and we want the environment to be very quiet well with these guys they don't care, and they talk so loud and people outside would be talking so loud that it makes it really hard to concentrate. My boss who is the director of the department allows it to happen I can't believe he wouldn't at least try to talk to them or anybody from my department. When I was in college, they wouldn't allow that to happen.

Things got worse when the actual semester had started. I was originally working 24 hours for the first five weeks the first two weeks were finals and the four weeks was winter break for the college, so I was pretty much in the office majority of the time. When the semester had started, I only gotten 11 hours and each day I was only scheduled to come in for about three hours max.

371,2024-07-10,Reporting that you got injured on the job? You’ll get written up for ‘working unsafely’ if you do!,u/FeralWereRat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e03y0u/reporting_that_you_got_injured_on_the_job_youll/,antiwork,"Found this out from my partner who works for a large grocery store chain; if you get hurt at work, upper management will fucking _write you up _ for ‘working unsafely’ which is insane. I worked there as well, but before they started punishing people for reporting injuries. I’m absolutely infuriated by this policy, as I have had bad experiences with works comp before where the company harassed me for daring to be injured.

I have a story about my own experience getting hurt at this job, as well. Suffice it to say, most jobs in the retail industry absolutely _hate_ when one of their employees dares to get hurt while on the clock.

I had worked at this store a few years back and was injured by a piece of shitty equipment that my coworkers had also been complaining about being dangerous long before I was there. It was a clothes rack that I was dragging into the back room— ‘safety’ latch collapsed under the weight of the clothes and crushed one of my fingers, trapping it between two metal bars. 

The heavy weight of the clothes kept my finger pinned and it was a frantic struggle to get the digit out before the weight sank me further. Blood started pouring out of the wound and I stood there for a second in an ‘ohshitohshitohshit’ panic as the pain indicated this wasn’t just bad pinch.

I was dripping blood onto the floor and felt like I couldn’t go get help because I was scared of getting yelled at for ‘creating a biohazard’ mess. _(I really should have just said fuck it and left in hindsight, but I was at the end of a long shift and not thinking clearly once I was injured.)_ 

I managed to flag down another employee to get a manager. It was probably another 5 minutes passed before one of the various managers finally showed up. Dude takes a look at my injury and says ‘ok, now that you’ve let me know you got hurt, you’re gonna keep working right?’ I just stared at him in disbelief, and said “NO— I am going to the ER now.” I ended up needing stitches and have a permanent divot that scarred over.

I was on reduced duty for a week, and the management of my department was _not happy _ with me. "

This is a longer story, so going to try and keep it short. About a month ago, I reached out to my boss about some issues myself and follow coworkers were having regarding another coworker and asked to speak with her as a group. She refused, stating she didn't want to create a ""groupthink"" type of mentality and would meet with us during our reviews. (Even though, just the week before I have an email that my boss was encouraging peer pressure to get me into the office 5 days a week (hybrid schedule)) My review went fine, we talked about my work and then my issues with the coworker. My boss only had one comment about where should could see improvement, otherwise was happy with my work. She said she would like to meet as a group then to discuss everything once she met with everyone. Our group meeting is set for tomorrow afternoon. I found out today through payroll that I didn't get a raise this year, and I'm pretty sure it's connected to me bringing up issues. (I'm working on getting things in writing and if this is the case, I will report my boss for retaliation, I just need to look up the steps) My question is, how to do ask my boss what is the incentive to staying her long term if there is no guarantee of a bonus every year? They offer no benefits other than bottom tier health insurance. We get 10 PTO days with no opportunity to get more for staying with the company longer. We get no retirement/401k. I literally just get a paycheck every week. How do I ask my boss what the incentive is to stay in a professional way?

Settle in, this is long.

  
I work for a thriving services company in North America. We'll just call it Brand. Brand has a mobile workforce that goes out onsite to help our customers and does not come into the office much. It makes sense that everything we do should ultimately meet that end - providing positive outcomes while servicing our customers.



Brand has a person leading IT that does not do IT. This person is very smart and generally I like them a lot. They did a wonderful job hiring the people to do IT. Unfortunately, the top brass still sees this individual as our definitive IT expert (they are not), and worse, the person has been in leadership for so long that they're drowning in de-contextualized data and losing grip on the genuine reality of the company.



Years ago, we had needs for a very nice, very large space that could be used for the most important big meetings and get togethers. This same IT lead got starry-eyed while looking at a fancy setup somewhere, and because they wanted it, we end up getting a MASSIVE tv setup literally built into the walls of the room - total cost? $55,000. This was, absurd and silly, but as a one-off cost it was at least ignorable. A splurge expense. Fine.



Well, it turns out another smaller branch also soon wants a meeting room, and so does another one. For them the cost does not even remotely make sense, and really can't be justified at all. These same places have been functioning fine with $2500 setups for years, and I want to emphasize that this is just for routine meetings with our professionals that go service clients - we're talking powerpoints and narration a few hours per month. That's what this is used for. 



Oh well, at this point, the IT lead has lost their mind, and before too long, we now have *three* of these setups. **Total cost? $165,000. Before tax.** The last $110,000 of this is in every way literally just completely wasted money.



Fast forward to last month, we have another office that literally meets in a garage one morning per week for a catch up meeting. They talk about goals and look at spreadsheets and stuff. Same as those other offices. They seat about 100 people (this is not as much as it sounds, think like 10 x 10 chairs). 



They approach me asking for a solution because their TV screens are not visible to the people in the back. I'm *pretty good* at my job so I come up with a nice solution that makes them happy and will solve the problem for a few thousand dollars. It's cool, fits the garage environment, and the people who *asked me for it* are *happy with it* as a solution. **I want to emphasize that. The people that asked for it were very happy with my inexpensive solution.**



While this is going on, we needed summer help because we're understaffed. My team believes in ""paying it forward"", so we get a completely fresh faced new college kid with no experience, so he can *get some* experience. We'll train him, help him, whatever - if you're smart and you'll work hard when it's called for, that's all we need.



They decide our budget for him $12/hr. This is less than the chik-fil-a down the street pays. We fight with leadership to pay more, but the answer comes back ""Why would we pay more if we don't have to? He needs experience on his resume that's part of his compensation."" This is a tech job. Our qualifications are at least 2 years in college working towards a tech degree. We fight and fight but they won't listen, and our summer help, doing difficult IT work that requires a huge degree of trust and care, is now making a below fast food wage.



Fast forward a few weeks, and my meeting room solution for the garage makes it to the IT Lead for approval. They promptly dump on it for the reason that ""no, we need the same meeting equipment everywhere"" and they proceed to force our team to contract out another $55,000 media installation. In a literal garage. Mind you - the only reason this setup exists in more than one place is because they wasted $110,000 to put it in two unnecessary places already.



**TLDR;** I now have to get a quote and installation date to literally waste almost $60,000, for massively overkill meeting equipment that people didn't even ask for, but I'm not allowed to pay my summer hire a living wage. He will help handle this install. He's going to have to help build $60,000 of utter waste, while the company looks him dead in the eye and says they can't pay him a living wage.



I'm going to throw up."

I 24m work a minimum wage job as an oil technician, basically changing oil on cars. 

Every few months, one of the customers is a dominos pizza driver. He always gives a half a dozen pizza vouchers to us (1 free large 3 topping pizza). Last time the customer did this, my manager gave me one coupon. Today, we got them again, but this time he put the coupons in a drawer and didn’t offer to give us any. I was working and I had to open the drawer so I noticed them and saw a few of them were missing. I assumed my manager took one or something.

I took one and slid it in my pocket. I figured if they asked about it I’d just say “I thought everyone was gonna get one so I took one anyway”. And if they end up giving me one at the end of the shift, I’ll just say I already have one.

Is this considered stealing? 

I’ll confess something while I’m here. 
Two weeks ago a customer came in. I was the customer service person this time, not working on the car. I did my usual routine. He then asked me two questions at the end of the service. He said “im gonna ask something very personal. What does your name mean?” I told him it means “chosen”. He said “ahh, chosen.. well I’ll ask you another question. Can you keep a secret?”
I say yes. He shows me a folded up $100 bill in his hands and tells me “I’ll give this to you as long as you promise to never tell any of your coworkers about it, can you do that”
I was really low on money. So I took it. He said “I just like the way you went about things. It’s a tip.” I said I thought it was a trick question, but he did hand the 100 to me, luckily no one was around us as they were all busy. I said I’ll honor the promise, said thank you, and asked him for his name. and he went. I haven’t told a single coworker and I don’t plan on doing it."

So, I called the California DIR. They clarified that since California's definition of compensable time includes any time you are *permitted* to work and under the control of your employer, not being allowed to leave and being allowed to assist campers is compensable time and not paying it would be illegal.

I was talking to my mom about it, and she suggested I just work the shift then file a wage claim at the end of the summer. I felt like leaving my coworkers behind like that wouldn't be right, but that was my tentative plan so as not to risk retaliation or just a Terrible Vibe.

Until during our staff meeting at the end of the day, our supervisor (*not* manager in charge of payroll -- she's one of us she just oversees camp) told us we aren't going to be allowed to sleep in tents because we need to be ""accessible"" to campers.

I just burst out an ""Ok. Then we need to be paid."" and from there went on to say this was illegal and explain why. All my coworkers agreed and we all decided we should stick together on this and try to get paid, and if refused, *all* file wage claims or even strike. I felt so much better knowing they were on my side and we would have each other's backs.

The next day supervisor texted manager to ask clarifying questions about payment, hours, and expectations so we'd have it on record. Today, she (manager) came to the work site to set up our direct deposits and do timecards for this and last week, and I brought it up with her myself one on one. I told her requiring us to be there but off the clock wasn't legal, and she seemed to genuinely not have really realized that. She said she needed to call *her* manager. I was so anxious the rest of the day that I'd fucked up and was gonna lose my job or make enemies.

But once I got home, I got a text: we are all going to get paid. All my coworkers thanked me for talking to our manager about it. I'm still kind of stunned that I managed to actually help and I'm so fucking glad I didn't just quietly work through it. I feel the solidarity with my coworkers now and none of us will have to do all that goddamn paperwork! Now I can actually look forward to the sleepover LOL.

Thanks to you all too for the advice on my previous post!"

Long story short, I got a new job after being unemployment for almost nine months. I'm a contractor hired on as a Grant Specialist. I had to take a pay cut because this was the only job offer I got and my unemployment benefits ran out.

Fast-forward a few weeks and my superiors keep telling me they like my work and want me to apply for a similar role directly. Well, this new role is still less pay than my last job and it's more work.

I'm so tired of basically climbing down the corporate ladder because no one wants to pay me more than entry-level wages. I'm in my 30s with lots of work experience. I don't understand why I keep getting pushed down, even when I'm told I'm doing well. I'm so tired of living like this. Not to mention, I have never had a job I felt passionate about. I genuinely just do it because I need the money.

I love what I do and have been doing it for many years. Ive been at this specific job for about 2 years and despite previous knowledge and experience, I'm still treated like an idiot. While I don't like how I've been treated, I hate how my youth have been treated by other staff/supervisors even more. 

I've seen kids (and GOOD staff) get hurt by improper safety procedures. I've seen staff be openly racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic to our youth. I've seen staff deny youth their basic needs and things they have rights to. I've been left with more youth than our laws allow. I've seen people disregard every policy and procedure we have. Before you ask if I have reported this, yes I have. I am a mandated reporter and it is part of my job to report it. It is my supervisors job to follow up and ensure it does not happen again. It happens again. Every time. 

Finally I put my notice in and gave 3 weeks instead of 2. They suddenly decide they don't need me for the 3rd week. I scramble today to try to meet with most of my youth to explain to them that I'm leaving. Most of them cried. One of them said ""if you leave, who will be here when I actually need help, who will support me when no one else does?"" That's when I cried. 

PSA: If you ever try to get a job in human services, please ask yourself if you care enough to do this type of job because most people I've seen in this field do not. 

I thought I was crazy and maybe things weren't as bad as I was making them out to be. Just today 3 other staff have told me today that they're also quitting because they can't take it. My HR rep said she's quitting as soon as she can. No one asked why I would want to leave, instead they said ""congrats on getting out of here."" That's when I knew this place is literally hell and I'm glad I'm finally out. I will miss these kids so much. Each person I've worked with has helped me to learn and grow and I'll always be thankful for that. I wish I had better faith in this place but it makes me sick to think about all the future incidents the supervisors will sweep under the rug. "

I was working at a law firm temp to perm since March 2024. Yes, through a recruiting agency. They promised my recruiter there was a chance of permanent in paperwork. 

I was hired to help client relations while two people were on maternity leave. One of them came back in May and she doesn’t even do my job. And the other one does genuinely do client intake. Well July has been the month where girl number 2 would come back. Actually, she returns tomorrow.

When girl 1 came back, she did not like me at all. She would constantly target me and accuse me of not knowing things. She would shit on me in the client relations group chat or on a client’s case file for all of them to see if she perceived I did something wrong. Supervisor never corrected her. But one of her bosses wanted her fired?

My supervisor was super critical of me - I asked her if the girls could tell me I was doing well. She said “I wouldn’t expect positive feedback from them because they’re focused on their own leads” as everyone gave each other positive feedback. My supervisor said her role was made up. This shows because she pulled our numbers weekly to see if we were doing enough or making the conversion rate. HR and admin lady said they were going to investigate both situations.

I asked twice about my status. I was told to wait til pregnant girl 2 came back. So I worked super hard. July has been my best month. I was getting at least 3 signs a day so far and had great ranking on my numbers. Attorneys were singing my praises the past two months and I shadowed a lot of them. I learned about things outside of my job description and I even did weekly mentoring with one of the attorneys. I stayed overtime this week to sign. I pushed myself despite being chronically ill and buying into the corporate lie while getting flare ups.

I get called into the admin lady’s office today.. she tells me she has to let me go because they cannot afford me(?). Mind you every girl in our department was hired through this same recruiting company. I asked her what I did wrong and she assured me it was nothing. I asked her if it’s because of how I was treated. She told me I was bright, respectful, a hard worker, one of the best they have, super talented and that “when my recruiter gets me another place to work I will be encouraged and that this has happened back in her day”. She said she can write me letter of recommendation lmao. 

I told her I cared about the clients and now they won’t trust anyone. I knew I was doing horrible and she kept saying that wasn’t true. She was saying she was super surprised to see I was this upset. 

She said my recruiter was unhappy. I asked her if my supervisor knew and she said yes only her HR and supervisor know. I felt betrayed.

She offered to walk me out because she felt like I wasn’t good to drive and I asked one of the attorneys to instead. However she asked me to come back tomorrow and get my things then. Why? Now I have to go back there.

I was told by everyone I’d be made perm and I was doing so well. Maybe this was a toxic work environment because the way I slaved had me obsessing over tasks even on weekends. And the passive aggressive drama.

For her to say they battled with the decision sounds like BS to me. To not give a transitional period to help finish everything out is insane and inconsiderate to the girl coming back AND  me.

All that fucking work for nothing yall. I was told it’s strictly numbers. They don’t care about these clients, just their money. Just this same day I was in a partner office for an hour to check my progress and laughing..what is the point of working? It is a lie and I risked my health to work here. It was hard enough getting this job. I don’t want to start over. I don’t want to do anything. I don’t know. I am sorry for yapping just feel discouraged.

These are 19 and 20 year old children which they have even modified work days, as on the job PAID training days for them with journeymen workers .

I have been SAd by a coworker before here, harassed by numerous others.I reported it with backlash,almost like I shouldve allowed it to happen because its a male dominated industry(they enforce a sexual harassment course and even give a raise to those journeymen who take it )and since then I have had rumors following me from company to company over 2 years later that I truly suspect may contribute to my lack of hours and of course income to pay my bills .I have since been afraid to report anything else like work conditions and have had other women tell me theyre being harassed by the ususal suspects even some asking me for advice.My outcome wasn't successful I can't even recommend anything .I bust my ass come more prepared and knowledgeable than alot of people there to do the tasks required .My skill level is not what I'm being hired for ,it's solely based on character and what happened to me .I'm literally at a loss here what can be done ?

However, the presentation started of by discussing the top causes of it in the workplace, nearly all of which were factors directly controlled by a business/organization such as workload and low staffing.

In light of this, I asked the upper management while they were hosting a meeting with staff if anything was being done by administration to address burnout in our own organization. Their response was that they bought us all a year subscription to the Calm App and that, really, it's just a stressful time to be a US citizen because of everything going on in politics. I suppose the app is better than pizza (I can't even eat cheese), and I do love a good ambient music playlist to fall asleep to. Maybe it was too much to hope they'd form at least a focus group."

10,2024-07-11,The Fourth Circle of Hell,u/BaskingInDarkness,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e0hcow/the_fourth_circle_of_hell/,antiwork,"So maybe it is that this is more venting than anything, but I have to get it off my chest: the drug rehab place I work at is a toxic hellsite that, if it was a circle of Dante’s hell, would be the fourth circle - greed. I’ve been with this company for coming up on five months now, and I cannot begin to emphasize just how money driven the company’s entire leadership is, right in tandem with a staff that is extremely toxic on its own right. For one, they cannot keep any decent people to save their life - the lack of raises, blatant favoritism, constant gaslighting from upper management, low pay and unrealistically high workload chases off a lot of potentially good staff.

Two, what is left for staff are universally toxic people who got their positions through blatant nepotism in this place. The director of operations is no different - this is a person with no prior experience who got into a position paying over $100,000 a year by being friends on the outside with upper management. He will schedule out vacations without planning at all for the reduction in staffing levels, and like clockwork, he is always scrambling at the last minute to get gaps in the schedule filled. He periodically will hire new people, but they almost always end up on swing shift. He cannot get anyone to really work days for the second half of the week or even night shift, which has translated into a situation where, with the exception of a handful of days, I have constantly had to cover almost an entire extra shift for close to five months since starting, this after having already worked a ten and a half hour shift where I am constantly stuck running our detox unit alone and with zero breaks. Nobody up the chain will offer higher pay, better shift differentials or even incentives to work weekends, which exacerbates everything - and all out of an unwillingness to part with even a portion of their already bloated salaries out of sheer greed and selfishness.

Swing shift for their part do not help. They tend to abandon their post the minute my shift arrives at night, claiming as they do that they have to help out at the front desk - leaving us to handle all the rounds, obtaining a ton of vitals, cleaning, restocking, helping nursing with getting numerous clients up to them, constantly trying to deal with often needy or pissed off clients and handling the phones - while they spend the remaining two and a half hours of their shift hanging out up front and doing nothing of note. Our rounds alone are every 15 minutes in detox, a thing which only happened because everyone from the director of operations on up refused to recognize that we weren’t getting even 30 minute rounds in on time because the amount of work we are doing is too much for one staff member to even keep up. Even during that point when we had 30 minute rounds, they actually expected us to take our lunch breaks in between rounds but yet would scream at us for leaving our assigned areas. And they refuse to hear us out at all when we tell them we are being burned out.

Much of this would be resolved if they raised the fucking pay, but the CEO simply gaslights us and tells us to apply for public assistance - this while he kicks it in an $8 million dollar mansion and drives around in a literal Bentley. All while fleecing other rich people who have an addiction with rehab treatment that is a joke. And nobody has the genuine interest in organizing into a union, as they all sincerely believe it would never work. And so I am looking for another job, but I am having no luck yet. All while trapped among a bunch of sycophants, ass kissers, greedy executives and some of the laziest pieces of shit I have ever seen in my working life. And the real sticking point is that every place like this is the same exact way.

TLDR: fuck the treatment industrial complex. Nationalize it today and clean house as it happens."

I took the initial offer of $64,480 when I first got the job with the assumption that this was going to pay off in the long run with a salary y increase to match both inflation and the high cost of living in San Diego. I recently had a performance evaluation about a month ago and overall had exceptional performance results. Considering I am going back to school for my masters I wanted to assure my finances were in order prior to starting classes.

Just flat out disrespected knowing that new grads are making far more than I am with 2 YOE under my belt. I’ve been working on applying to new jobs as soon as I got home.

Having a group of the workers confront the managers when they do something wrong is powerful. 

However we do not work in manufacturing as a whole. Our economy has transferred into a service based economy.

6,2024-07-11,My assistant makes more than me...,u/queerbbsqurrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e0nozq/my_assistant_makes_more_than_me/,antiwork,"So I've been working at a restaurant for coming up on 2 years now. I (f,26) worked my way from the bottom to a GM position in less than a year. I did so well that they had me open a brand new store, which was a lot of work (hiring 30 brand new employees, training them, building equipment for the store, ordering everything and placing those things, this all took about a month of work by myself). At this new store I was given an assistant manager to train and help me get days off. 

Now this guy comes from another company where he was also an AGM. He (m,28) said he has over 8 years of experience being an AGM at his last job and had done training before. Great! Exciting! Yeah, no.... This man is so dirty and does not know anything about how we do things at our company. His ordering is all over the place, he skips over important things that he thinks I won't notice, he tells the employees to do things that are wrong, the employees complain that he doesn't do anything but sit at the desk all day and makes them leave early, he rides the clock and gets over time when hes told not to. 

The reason I am upset and have a problem is he makes $19 an hour plus tips which usually equates to about $8 an hour on top of the $19. My boss gave him this amount (note the starting pay rate for his position is usually $15.50/hr or a salary position) because of his ""experience"". I'm doing payroll every other week and hes making $2300+ every pay check. While I'm on salary making $1500 every 2 weeks. I can't help but get upset when I do payroll because he should've never received the pay rate he has. He doesn't pull his weight and takes tips from the other employees (they have a tip pool and split amongst each other - the more hours you work the more tips you get - he's required to work 40 hours a week). 

This past month I've also been training a MIT (manager in training) who is another friend of my boss's. I'm supposed to be getting a $250 bonus on my check for this and have not been paid for that. 

I guess I'm wondering if it's okay to go to HR and ask why someone below me is making more than me with less experience in the company? I feel like I've proven myself time and time again and keep getting these ""promotions"" with no gain. This is also not the first time that my boss has hired a man who is one of his buddies to work under me and makes more than anyone else in the store. In my mind that seems backwards. 

My boss tells me ""Well you get perks of the job that he does not receive."" These perks being 3 weeks of paid vacation time per year, a bonus of up to $1800 every 4 months based on store performance and a retirement fund. 

Does this makes sense to anyone and seem fair? I'm not sure how to talk to my boss about it. "

But the job has a risk element involved were it could end suddenly or little to no upward mobility.

The second job I interviewed with 4 times, 3 of them in person, including a visit to the site I would be taking over. And there was talk about how the company is quickly growing and they liked me for potential movement upwards in the company. But there were to me some huge red flags.

For a salaried, management position there was ZERO benefit package. Not even basic medical. The position I was interviewing for change several times during the process. During one interview I would be looking at taking over location A, but during the next interview it was location B. And during the final interview I straight asked what the pay was going to be (since the site was an hour away from home and I'd need to pay my own medical and they knew that) neither of the two people I was with were willing or able to tell me. Which told me I was about to get low balled. The whole process felt like one giant red flag and I would have ended up miserable there. "

7,2024-07-11,Why should I go to an in-person interview 4 hours away on short notice? (Vent),u/rllylongname,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e0rpah/why_should_i_go_to_an_inperson_interview_4_hours/,antiwork,"So I was VERY excited about this really cool job opportunity to interview for that would really help me in a lot of ways (career projection, increase financial stability, finally moving back to where I want to live, etc). I make 44k now with awful benefits (have a masters degree in social work) this job would pay 85k.
However, here’s the kicker….

The one supervisor gave me a call back saying the interview would be in person, which confused me because all my interviews last fall were virtual. I told her I live 4 hours away. I also had sent her an email a half hour prior saying mornings are the worst time for me and afternoon works better (I run group therapy sessions all morning, we are short staffed and it’s hard to cover that sometimes). And on the phone she stated “so I saw mornings are better for you.” …I said the OPPOSITE. 

Anyways, she has to ask her supervisor if they will allow me to do virtual. Which she can’t find out for me until Monday…the day before the interview is suppose to take place (Tuesday or Wednesday). And look, I can’t just pick up and leave my job with no notice, to drive 4 hours, for a job I might not get. I don’t have enough leave to do that every time I have a job interview. It’s just frustrating all around. 

TLDR: the job to interview for pays 85k and I get paid 44k, interview is 4 hours away, I won’t know if they can do a virtual interview until the day before the interview. If they can’t do virtual it is impossible for to go there with that short of notice with the little PTO I have. "

I planned on giving my employer 2 weeks notice, I really did. But I decided today that I am torching this bridge. I noticed early on the environment and leadership was extremely toxic, I also think the business is only a bad month away from completely going under. It was honestly so bad, that when the CEO and CTO went on leave around the same time you could feel the energy shift. Think of that picture of Nicole Kidman after her divorce from Tom Cruise. 

Today, HR made an announcement that if an employee resigns with a week PTO within a month of the date they turn in the notice, they would pay out PTO balances. It's not legally required they pay it in my state, but it is fairly rare a company doesn't.

I had planned on using my PTO, then submitting notice. I do have a new gig lined up. The second I heard the new policy, I just kind of snapped. I am signed in for today, but plan on boxing up my equipment with my resignation letter, and shipping it back to arrive on the Monday I would have returned from vacation.

He spoke words with absolutely zero substance for a full hour. When he finally got to slides that warranted discussion (lack of pay equity, DE&I issues, etc.) he simply said “yeah we have work to do” without proposing any solutions. He said that “everyone wants more money, right? Haha”. I recorded his worst parts on my phone, to show my family how ridiculous it is. 

Myself and many people on this team are burnt out, downtrodden, and pretty much ready to quit due to the ridiculous workload, and this guy is laughing at our pay inequity issues. We keep acquiring more and more companies, but don’t add any headcount, and expect people to bend over and take it, all for a 3% annual raise. 

Fuck corporate America. Within the next 5 years, I’m getting out of here. It’s a promise I’ve made to myself.

6,2024-07-11,Overtime Exempt Employee - New DOL Minimums ,u/843865,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e0v1m3/overtime_exempt_employee_new_dol_minimums/,antiwork,"So I’m in rural Wisconsin (USA) and I make about $39,000 a year as a salaried employee who is not eligible for overtime pay. 

My position is weird because I work at a school and live on campus. The school provides my (furnished) apartment, utilities, internet, and a meal plan as part of my compensation. Only the meal plan has any data attached to it though, my “rent” is nonexistent and the school owns the building I live in and the land it’s on and doesn’t meter out my power or water, so there’s just no record of how much of that the school is covering on my behalf. This is obviously a huge additional benefit of this job though and probably would put me right around the new January 1, 2025 $54,000 minimum if there were a way to quantify it.  

I’m considered a supervisor. I oversee a staff of about a dozen part-time employees (none of them are full time because they’re all students), meeting with them, scheduling their shifts, running weekly staff meetings. Most of my work is at a desk with me deciding what tasks I need to do it what order. I don’t think I can officially hire/fire people, but I can recommend to my supervisor. 

I also work on-call “shifts” as part of this job where I hold an emergency phone for a few days every month in the evenings and over the weekend and I’m expected to respond to any calls within 10 minutes. I don’t receive any additional compensation for an on-call shift, nor anything for actually taking a call. The nature of these calls is usually emergency response or community guideline enforcement so I’m running around dealing with drunk people, meeting EMTs, cleaning up an overflowing toilet, telling people to be quiet. But this is only about one week out of the month that I’m on call and for the most part nothing happens. But there have been multiple weeks where I’ve worked a full 40+ hour work week only to additionally work from 6pm to 6am Friday night. I’d say I regularly work 45 hour weeks and sometimes work as much as 80 hours in a week during the really busy times of the year. 

I can ask my supervisor for days off pretty much whenever I want. There’s no specific limit and they’ve never said no so far. But there’s no system in place for me taking time off and there’s no record of it in our payment tracker. But I do get off pretty much whenever school is out, including a month in the summer and still receive payment. I get paid the same every two weeks regardless of how much time I take/get off. 

My supervisor was talking about the January 1st, 2025 DOL minimum salary increase and saying how this could affect my position and was surprised that none of the higher ups had given my supervisor any idea of how my position (and maybe even his) would get reclassified. I looked through the staff council meeting notes (which I don’t think I’m invited to attend) and it looks like they last talked about it in May and said they’d wait to see if it passes before taking action. They didn’t mention it in the June meeting minutes. 

But in looking into this, I noticed that as of July 1, 2024, the new minimum is $43,000, which is $4000 more than what I’m currently making. I haven’t received a July paycheck yet, but since no one at the school has really talked about the minimum salary increase, I’m assuming it won’t be any different. 

If the school doesn’t increase my July paychecks is that wage theft? I’ve heard a lot of people say the new DOL minimums are still waiting approval and the election could affect what happens to them, but from everything I’ve read, it sounds like it’s already happening? 

I’ve heard from other schools that are trying to plan for this and figure out what’s the best way to classify this weird live-on position. People have suggested everything from switching to hourly to “charging” for housing so it looks like the minimum is being met on paper but the money is really going back to the school. 

Is this even worth bringing up? I’m not sure who to talk to. HR here is one person who already had a full time job and just absorbed the position after someone else recently left. I’m also not sure I’d get paid more being switched to hourly and I have no idea how I’d keep track of my hours or even what would count as “work”. Should I be keeping track of my hours regardless? A part of what the students I supervise do is put on events that I go to and enjoy and it’s not “required” I go to all of the events, but it is required I go to some, but sometimes I stay and talk…how much of that is “work”? (Personally I think all of it, but I don’t think my supervisor would agree). 

I’m sorry this is so long. I’m just really confused and feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I feel like my supervisor doesn’t like me bringing it up. 

TL;DR - The new DOL overtime exempt salary increased to $43,000 on July 1, 2024 (which is less than what I currently make at $39,000 a year), but I don’t think my employer will be increasing my pay because they don’t think the new DOL overtime exempt minimums will “pass” and they literally can’t afford to pay me more, definitely not the January 1st, 2025 $54,000. I work in a live-on position that provides my housing (not documented) and a meal plan (documented), probably making my total compensation about $54,000 a year if there were a way to measure the additional benefits. Is this wage theft? And if so, should I do anything about it? What can I do? Who can I talk to? "

1,2024-07-11,Having to start a Gofundme to help with medical expenses while working a position in the health care industry that abuses employees for taking medical leave.,u/Silver-Syndicate,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e0vrra/having_to_start_a_gofundme_to_help_with_medical/,antiwork,"Title sums it up, but this job is way more shit than what's seen on the outside.

I have a meeting with my manager today to talk about my ""time off."" And to just put a little micromanaging cherry on the cake, he sends me a text after I responded to the email he sent, saying:

""I sent you an email about a meeting to discuss your missed time. Make arrangements to be there.""

Like, no shit, jackass, I responded to it already saying I'd show up. Funny how you never respond to my requests for meetings.

But my job is literally shoveling shit. I can't violate my NDA, but I can say that I work with a multitude of Biohazards on a daily basis in a laboratory with no hazard pay, making 18 an hour. I have never gotten a raise, and am ignored when asking for a higher position. I've been here five fucking years and have gone more than above and beyond as I'm the guy who has trained nearly all of the current staff, including my supervisor who used to be my fucking trainee. This is a multi-billion dollar industry, and they can't even afford to pay their employees a living wage.

In addition, we get only two leave days per month, or I should say, we get 14 hours per month. 8 for sick, 8 for vacation. That's it. And they put it in as ""hours"" and not ""days"" so they can clock each time you are late for any reason on your schedule and slowly chip away at your time. Oh, and no overtime, that's prohibited, and no making up for time missed, also prohibited.

I take time off for my medical, I have a lot of health issues that I need to address in the little time I'm given, and I have very rarely gone over my allotted time (even if I come into work feeling like my head is going to explode and my guts are being ripped out.) On the days I don't have time, which are very few, I get a doctor's note to cover my medical reasons for HR. However, that doesn't matter to them, it also doesn't matter that I'm in control of two buildings and have worked my ass of, by myself, to maintain them and be sure that everything follows SOP procedures.


I am always questioned about my medical, I am always judged for it, and don't have any other choice but to play nice and be professional about the fact that my boss actively violates HIPA law, while also actively going against the SOPs and yelling at me when something gets messed up because of it. I am blamed for anything and everything, even with my records being squeaky clean.

Now that I've been so sick that I damn near passed out in the break room and vomited on the stairs, it seems that they've finally found a reason to put something on my record, and I have to go to a meeting to defend myself having medical problems, even though I have medical leave and Doctors notes.

So now I'm probably going to be written up for something I have documentation of, and something I can't control. I'm sorry that me being sick doesn't work on a fucking schedule.

Now I'm not only dealing with that, but currently setting up a Gofundme just to pay for both mine and my partners medical as we're barely scraping by. The only reason I have stayed at my job this long is for the insurance, something that is literally handcuffing me here because if I leave, there's a chance I won't have mine or my partners medical needs covered as the state sees it as a ""preexisting condition.""

It's sad that I'm already working my ass into the ground, and then get blamed for being sick, have to work even harder, and then get more ill because of it.

When your medical workers can't even pay for the medical they help produce or have the time to take care of themselves? There's a fucking problem.

Probably going to end up applying somewhere else at this point if they do decide to write me up, but in the meantime, I'm just going to pray that by some good fortune, my Gofundme brings in something to help us.

I am genuinely embarrassed for having to ask for help from people I don't even know and putting my problems out to the wind, but at this point it's either charity or continue suffering at the hands of a broken system that's going to either drive me homeless, or work me until I pass out and don't wake up. I literally fuckin' hate myself for asking for help, but hate the system even more because I am out of options.

Oh, and my boss and my supervisor get all the medical leave they want. They literally either leave early or work remotely while the hands on employees stress over handling literal shit for five days a week.

The ""American dream"" is literally just dreaming about the day when you can not only afford to be sick, but have the time to be."

My hands are sore as FUCK right now and it's not good as an artist and a student.

To give an example as to why:


Today I had to fill out orders for multiple units and these were the biggest orders I got today alone--

Unit A wanted 40 gowns, 40 blankets, 40 bed pads, 40 pillowcases, 40 bedspreads, 40 flat sheets, 40 fitted sheets, 40 bath towels, 40 hand towels, and 40 wash clothes.


Unit B wanted 20 gowns, 20 blankets, 20 bed pads, 20 pillowcases, 20 bedspreads, 20 flat sheets, 20 fitted sheets, 20 bath towels, 20 hand towels, and 20 wash clothes.

This doesn't count how many pounds of laundry we had to sort, wash and fold today. We are short staffed and we're are still dealing with the toxic workers. I cannot emphasize enough that these sorts of orders are common and it isn't uncommon for them to send that shit back only to call and asked for these same orders.

And they expect us to do this every now and then when working with people, which means, at some point, I may be asked to write a review on someone's behalf. I don't recall getting paid for this.

I just find the whole stance to be odd and somewhat contrived. Anyone else deal with something like this?"

My coworker got a talking to for something small and silly and she told him ""if you can't handle this building I'll put you back in the floater pool"" and there is no documentation that this actually happened. As far as his employee records there are no write-ups or anything showing he has ever been reprimanded for anything. And to me it just feels incredibly hostile and unprofessional.

They then gave her “resources”, fired her, and changed the lock code. I don’t have her number but I hope she is okay. I can’t shake the fact that work may have been her safe space.

Cool, I hadn’t taken a week off in half a year so I decided it was time to file for two weeks off, taking place after hers as blackout dates are coming up (no vacation time during those).

I got caught up in selecting the dates I forgot to fill in the name part, no big deal, so I compete the rest of it.  
Now my supervisor, store manager, general manager, and even their best pal the receiver are crowded around talking about it when the GM asks “Why do you even want to take vacation? You don’t go anywhere, just going to sit around in your room for two weeks straight playing video games?”

0,2024-07-11,Government jobs skew the economy,u/iburiedmyshovel,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e11iow/government_jobs_skew_the_economy/,antiwork,"I saw a post in my homestate's sub stating that we have the top median salary. And it's because of government work, 100%.

Our economy is two part: production and service. 

Within production, capital is king, but ultimately, market forces allow for production to compete relatively fairly.  

But service is different. It's a market of the ethereal: what is your time worth?  

Every government job is a service job. The government produces no goods. Whether it be the IRS or homeland security or the NSA or the pentagon, up to our leaders in government, they are all technically service jobs. The military is purely service. 

And all those government jobs are backed by high pay and consistent raises and even pensions. 

I know so many idiots who work in government. But the pay isn't relegated to any market forces, because it acts independently based on policy, based on taxes raised by those who actually work within the economy. 

I think a *large* part of our economic employment problems are based on government policy. Too much money paid out to governmental employees, and those who do the dividing of funds are bought, by those in the actual capitalist market, to deregulate it. Taxes rise but only for the working class. Meanwhile, billions go unaccounted for or are fraudulently spent. Millions in ppp loans unaccounted for, but you want to collect 10k from me for the year. Millions in false over time from police, but property taxes just went up. 

Even the ""capitalist market"" isn't free.  How many cities have contracts with broadband providers that mean that their citizens only have one option for broadband cable and internet?  And how much of that was subsidized?  I'm fucking sick of Comcast, let me get Verizon service! 

But it's so funny, pushing for higher minium wages - which, if you noticed, supports my point, as the arguments always target service workers - is just obscene, apparently. 

We can regulate market goods (eg, tariffs, subsidies). We can regulate provided services (eg, broadband, civil service). But regulate market service?  Absurd! Communism! Fuck gig workers. Fuck unions. Fuck minimum wage. Fuck immigrants. And fuck you. 

It's the clearest epiphany I've had about the serfdom the wealthy, capital owning class is trying to create, and I just wanted to get out my thoughts. Cheers.

Recently, after nearly a year of taking in more responsibilities,  and proving myself, getting yes and nos and yes but not now, patiently waiting and modestly bringing it up only ever few months I finally got promoted to a higher level employee. Or did I? 

A promotion means more money..right?..

Well no. 

So, I’m European and English isn’t my first language, not sure what words to use but let’s say there are salary grades and salary levels. Let’s say I was in

Salary grade 1, level 2

A promotion means in my line of work (according to the collective employment agreement) means you go a grade up but two levels back which is the next higher salary. It’s often but a small difference but it matters. 

So I went up to
Salary grade 2, level zero. 


Then in addition every full year of employment gets you a level up. My next full year is completed Sept 1. I’d go up to Salary grade 1, level 3. No issue, you’d think.

I get the promotion now and the extra level because another year of employment in September. No. They don’t do that, they postponed that date by a year because my promotion overwrites that. 

Making me wait until this very specific month had to have been on purpose. This way they can scrap my yearly increase. Because it happened before it. And they didn’t have to pay me more than necessary for most of 2024. 

So.. in short: my promotion for which I’ve worked hard and taken on more responsibilities gets me the same salary as the one I would get in September by doing nothing but remaining employed...? How does that make ANY sense?

The last 8 months my schedule was consistent and had me working Thursday and Friday night and Saturday and Sunday morning. Im the only guy server and none of the female servers like me for a reason that is not my fault at all, (Older lady asked me to sleep with her daughter and I declined as I have a girlfriend and young son). Ever since this happened it’s been nothing but downhill and half the ladies hate me and the other half really like me because I’m our strongest server, great overall employee, and a nice guy. Anyways, the half of the servers who hate me convinced my boss to get me taken off morning weekend shifts, I work at a breakfast place so that’s our busiest shifts where we make the best money. When this happened, they moved me to Saturday and Sunday at noon rather than morning where I made less than half what I made before. I decided it was a gift from God and was telling me to move on with my career so i went and got an internship for what my area of study is, (current college student). The internship is a 9-5 which means I couldn’t work Thursday and Friday at the restaurant anymore and wasn’t going to bend over backwards for a place who didn’t value me as an employee. I then changed my schedule to just Saturday and Sunday at noon hoping that would stay consistent for me. Due to the toxic work environment and poor management, they lost almost all their night servers. Now they’re trying to get me to work outside of my availability, (4pm until close) which I told them simply can not happen because when they took my weekend morning shifts away, that forced me to get a second job but they’re telling me they won’t change that and that they have no servers, what do i do? I don’t wanna quit because the extra income from the weekends is great for my family and helps pay for necessities outside of bills such as groceries, clothes, diapers, etc. how do i respond to this? Do i just have them keep me scheduled and not show up and see if they fire me? Is that legal? Im trying to work with them and tell them I can work from 12-4 but can’t work from 4-close simply because of my other job which wouldn’t have been a problem if they would’ve never tried being revengeful or whatever they were seeking as my boss is best friends with the lady server that tried having me solicit her daughter. They pretty much screwed themselves because they would’ve been guaranteed two night shifts covered and possibly a few additional night shifts if they would’ve tried to stay on good terms with me and keep me on their weekend morning shifts.

I tried changing the settings on Google Voice to see if it would work, but it's either all or nothing. I want an app that will silence, including no alerts, M-F, after hours and on weekends.

I have to have access to texting this person M-F, during work hours, so I can't block her. Since my boss sent that email, whenever she texts me after hours, she says at the end of her texts, ""sorry to bother you after hours."" She knows she's the problem. 

Any suggestions?"

Thought I was doing the responsible thing by letting them know once I signed the offer that I had some tentative days off and was willing to adjust if needed for the company. It was a total of 6 days. I thought it was odd they asked me if I had plans for time off during the phone screen, which was weird. At that time, I only had plans for a vacation in December. The start date they chose just so happened to be during the same week I was going to be out of town one of the days. So I offered to start on the date they selected OR the following week if it was better for them. I would have canceled my plans had I known it was a deal breaker. They rescinded my offer once I let them know about the few days off."

It was along the lines of the company wasn’t purchasing more equipment for the year (not sure if true or not) and the other person turned that into “our office is getting closed” (not true) and it caused a big panic.  The top has caught wind and is in damage control while trying to determine who said it.  I’m not sure who but I have my suspicions.  My question is if all they have is two conflicting statements s“x said it” “no I didn’t” can they do anything if they can’t prove it?  Any legal options if so?

He goes crying to the boss cause he hides most of his normal hours and runs his mouth only. Myself and two other co-workers carry about 80-90% of the job. Boss won't even write him up for getting into it with me after getting into it with the other two past few weeks. 

Only to hear the boss talking about us to people who have 0 business knowing, they aren't management they're just people in diff departments and you guessed it talking badly about either both of us or one. In either case they don't need to know what either of us did or said. 

Needless to say I left and unsure if I'll return, don't care if someone from xyz knows who I am. I'm not a bad dude and will try to help out others. I'm born a bastard that doesn't mean people can treat me like one.

The fabrics are all polyester and when ironed they produced a shit ton of smoke. My office is super small and has no windows so the whole office is always completely saturated with smoke, to the point where everything looks hazy and white.

I was never given  ANY safety equipment, I’ve burned/cut myself many times yet we don’t even have a first aid kit, so usually if it’s a deep cut I just cover my hand with masking tape and toilet paper. 

For a year now I’ve been having some health issues, I’ve been extremely sleepy and sometimes feel as if I’m drunk after work, my throat is always super scratchy, sometimes I struggle to talk without coughing  in between words and my eyes turned yellow and hurt. 
I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, so I went to get tested for everything and it all came clear and good. 

When I told my doctor my working conditions he told me that my symptoms were most likely caused by the smoke and the lack of oxygen due to the smoke, and that I had the right to ask my boss for security equipment.

So I did, I told my boss that I had been having health problems due to the smoke and that I needed safety goggles and a mask that would protect me against smoke.
 She agreed but took a long ass time to buy it, and the day she finally bought it, she angrily called me over and held the mask in her hands and when I tried to grab it while saying thank you, she pulled it back and said in a nasty tone “I’ll only give it to you if you will actually use it, you better fucking use this because it was very expensive! And if you use it, you are no longer allowed to wear airpods and listen to music!”. 
The mask was 36 dollars, not exactly what I would call expensive, and I work alone so I don’t bother anyone by listening to music with earphones.

It left a really bad taste in my mouth that she was so nasty about it, specially when I asked for something that legally should have been provided from the start. I could have easily gone to a work inspection office and put a claim against them, but I gave them a chance to be civil. Yet they try to take my music away as a punishment.

Now, when I went in, the workplace environment was extremely relaxed. In downtime where there wasn't much work, everyone, including most managers, would casually do other things. They'd browse the Internet on their phones, some would chat with each other, one guy even brought in his putter and practiced putting golf balls in a small private room.

So I thought ""hey this is pretty casual, I'll join in"" and I'd talk to other people or look at stuff on my phone during downtime. Heck, one of the managers once sat down and talked about sports for 15 minutes to us. Note that I do take my work very seriously- I always do all the checks, do research properly, etc.

But one of the other managers is the liaison between our organization and the university I'm in. He's a little more serious, but has never written me up. He's never done anything to indicate the casual behavior I partake in is anything other than the norm in the workplace. The manager never did this as he knows very well that to single me out for this behavior would be unfair because senior employees and other managers participate in it.

Then I get an update from my university that the employer has found me ""very disappointing"" and that ""I spend a lot of time chatting and browsing the Internet"". I explained to the university that this behavior is very much the norm here but they brushed it off as a lower level employee trying to get the perks of a senior employee.  
  
The manager, who never expressed any disagreement or negative feedback to me, literally took the one avenue he could to reprimand me. He could not write me up as it is behavior many others partake in and the union would obviously disapprove. I thought I had found a job that was relaxed and that I could let my guard down, but I realize now there is no case where a manager can be your friend."

Of course I count medications, run a cash register, counsel patients, etc. which all require me to be on my feet. But another big part of my job is entering prescriptions on the computer or making phone calls to patients/doctors.

Today I was called into the office and told by my manager that she has received ""several"" complaints from store leaders about me sitting while working on these tasks - ""the chair is there to be used but you are abusing it."" She then went on to explain that customers in the drive through can see me sitting and that gives a bad perception of our pharmacy.

I'm sorry - but if I am doing the same work that has to get done, does it really MATTER whether I am sitting or standing?! I am hurting no one and I am doing my job, not playing games or twiddling my thumbs. I work my *ass* off all day every day, my back hurts, and I want to sit while still being productive.

It’s a six story building with 3 total janitors.  The other two are full time and are t true “company men”.  Both have e been there nearly 2 decades.  When I first started I was given a low use floor that management deemed would fit for my part time status.  I was able to finish it to their satisfaction with about 2-3 hours.  So I started doing detail tasks that weren’t on my job description to fill the time.  Not long after I’m running out of tasks to fill the time.  

Fast forward to today I’m now cleaning two floors (the same amount as those working full time) for the same number of hours at the same rate of pay and I’m still finishing with at least an hour left on the clock.  All because I’m a fast worker.  I don’t get more pay or more hours , just more work.  

My whole point after that ramble is why can’t labor jobs like this work on a type of commission?  I have a job: clean my floors, then get paid for cleaning.   Now I’m doing the same amount of work as full time workers on part time schedule.


Anyway sorry this post doesn’t have the drama of labor violations or politics or lawsuits.  It’s just me being grumpy that I can’t reduce my hours and get a raise at the same time."

We got a new manager at the start of July, so of course he’s making a few changes. One of the changes being he is making us write deal jacket paper (where we put customer info to identify which deal is for who) on a PDF, type it, print it and staple it on the file instead of writing it with pen to make a look cleaner. So I follow, I make the deal jacket that way and I forgot to add one thing so i wrote it with pen as clean as I can (Yeah, fucked up there). The deal jackets have a notes section where I can write things if I’m missing something or any important information that higher ups usually take care of. I write something in the notes with pen because I missed to make a print of the window sticker of that car before selling it. I put it in the notes just saying that basically.


Then fast forward a bit later I was driving somewhere and got a call about that deal asking why i wrote the things i did with the pen. I understand I made a mistake the one thing i missed in PDF was my fault but adding notes with pen was i think more justified. But then he goes onto say that he will basically demote me to the role i started from which will be a 1.50 hourly pay-cut and location change and i think he went too far with that, is that even legal??? But just logically and to save time writing it with hand is fast and efficient, but he made me rip that deal jacket paper, make another one and write basically the same things on the PDF while that could have very well been acceptable since my writing is readable.

It feels odd to say but my issue is that I don't like being walked over or treated unfairly, and when I've ever put my foot down it's led to me being treated even more unfairly. 

I feel so powerless. Of course managers are necessary to manage a team, but I'm losing count of the amount of times managers have been horrid to the team, and the team feel defenseless. And that's my problem, I speak up about things, I do so in a professional way but that doesn't matter when I'm below a manager, I still deal with consequences that are completely unfair and unwarranted, boarding onto bullying. 

What's made me feel more disheartened is my current job is in the museum sector. It's a charity, I thought the behaviors you usually find with managers in retail or customer service wouldn't be here, but it's not much different. I want to work in the museum and arts sector, but it seems no matter what sector I'm not safe from managers eventually revealing to be manipulative.

Sorry if mods don't like it! I'm still kinda new to this group.

I applied to work for a small accounting business last August (8 people including owner) and was there for 3 months before being let go in the most insufferable way I've ever had.

The owner was (probably still is) a rude, insensitive, sexist and racist asshole, and I was unfortunate enough to not see it until I'd accepted the job.

He proclaimed to be 'honest' and 'lighthearted', when actually he just made insensitive jokes about other people and was rude to their faces in the name of 'honesty'.
But when it came to telling someone that they smelled, for example (a college student through no fault of his own), he just talked shit behind their back and danced around the topic.

He'd also try to be best friends with everyone. And I mean this literally. Anything that suggested you didn't want to be besties with him, he'd take personally.
It was common for him to invite everyone out to meals and to clubs (most employees were 19 to mid 20s and he was in his late 40s with an adult daughter) to get hammered.

I'm an anxious person and I don't drink without my fiancé there since I get very clumsy when drunk and may end up injuring myself.
Apparently, declining those events was a mistake since he seemed to hate me more and more over those months.

He also didn't like that I had no accounting experience, despite hiring me knowing this fact. I was supposed to do my Level 2 during the apprenticeship, but instead I was doing Level 2 in college and at work I was doing Level 3 tasks with a mentor.
I couldn't keep up with both, and it was as if he (and others) were pissed off with me for not understanding.

I actually ended up getting frustrated with my mentor (he's not awful, just... stubborn) because I didn't understand why his method of doing something was better than mine despite getting the same results (a very minor thing, this will come back later).

The owner also liked making sexist remarks (especially after watching the Barbie movie with his daughter) and insentitive comments about Autism and ADHD, knowing full-well I have ADHD.
His mother worked with us and he was awful to her (80 yr old with heart problems) but she endured it for her son's business

During a morning when I was early, he was the only other person there and out of nowhere told me about a trip to China he had where he was offended they called him a racist term, then decided it was a great idea to use racist terminology for Chinese and Black people to 'prove his point' that they were rude.
We had a mixed-race apprentice, who I told about it afterwards as a warning...

In terms of college, everyone was lovely. The only issue was me not being informed I had a limited amount of time off (about 4 days) until I only had one left due to transport problems.
I then got Covid (great timing) and missed the last day, so it would mean I'd have to wait til next term to start again (fine by me).

Apparently, owner didn't like that and that was the 'official' reason I was let go.

I think he was looking for an excuse.

To start, I didn't get my monthly payment and nothing was said to me about it or needing to talk.
He held it over my head until I came in, completely baffled, and blindsided me with a 'talk' about letting me go.

None of my coworkers said anything either, just changed the seating plan which confused me more.

The talk was... something.
I was accused of being rude, lazy, a poor employee and argumentative. Remember that small frustration with a coworker? That was me being argumentative, apparently.

He even gave me a fucking letter disguised as an official 'letting go' letter that was paragraphs full of insults, just using fancy words this time.
Ive never been more humiliated or angry in that moment, especially when my coworkers said absolutely nothing to me afterwards, not even a 'bye'.

I should've known, really. They all had 'rich mindsets' and had expensive hobbies like golf (except one lady who was lovely and his mother), giving me weird looks when I mentioned I couldn't afford something.

My fiancé was right not to trust them (he told me this early on), but I, ever the optimist, ended up finding that out on my own.

4,2024-07-12,Lack of Bereavement Leave,u/jrjreeves,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1ds2x/lack_of_bereavement_leave/,antiwork,"Hey all,

I live in the UK and there are no laws here that make it a legal obligation that your organisation to pay you any bereavement leave.

In the last few days my dad passed away, whilst my mother passed about 20 years ago. I'm 38 years old and I would assume most people tend to have at least one parent alive at this point.

Anyway, my company isn't paying me anything for the time I'll be taking off. I'm not surprised, we don't get sick pay, meanwhile the managing director has multiple holidays a year and many sports cars and 4x4s to enjoy.

So I really think any company that doesn't pay any sick or bereavement should be ashamed of themselves and I do think it should be written in to law that any direct family member passing (limited to Grandparents, Parents, Siblings, Spouse or kids) should be paid by the company for 5 days.

So it's not really a rant, whilst being a rant at the same time."
17,2024-07-12,The Railway Labor Act is the single most damaging law to the rights of transportation workers.,u/Dependent-Gur6113,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1dsn7/the_railway_labor_act_is_the_single_most_damaging/,antiwork,"TL;DR: I am a airline pilot by trade and since I work in a ""essential industry to the American economy"", my union is regulated by the Railway Labor Act. This act is a muzzle on unions in the transportation industry and allows corporations to abuse union employees at will without any consequential recourse from the workers. 

**Background**


Note: I am not a scholar, i do not have any advanced academic degrees so bear with my crude attempt at this essay. I am simply a pissed off union pilot.

Remember the big railroad strike that went to Congress back in 2022? [1] Some of you might have thought, ""why don't those guys just walk off the job?"" Well, under RLA, this is illegal as the act was established the ensure that U.S Commerce and major transportation networks were not impacted. Per the Federal Railroad Administration [2] :

""The purposes of the RLA are to avoid any interruption of interstate commerce by 
providing for the prompt disposition of disputes between carriers and their employees and protects the 
right of employees to organize and bargain collectively.""

Sounds like a win-win for both sides right? Well let's step back in the history of railroad and airline labor relations for a minute. In 1877, a 4 year long recession was underway and railroads were impacted. The Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) Railroad implemented 10% wage cuts across the entire workforce [3], in response, workers began walking off the job and it spurred a nationwide strike that impacted nearly every railroad in the U.S National guard intervention was eventually used to quell the strike but the groundwork for more government intervention in railroad-union affairs was laid. [4]. Later, the Pullman Strike of 1894 [5] was spurred by more abusive employment practices and through a series of congressional acts, the groundwork for labor protections was built which you see today in overtime protections after 8 hours, prohibiting company scrip from being used in lieu of the dollar, etc. The U.S government and the owners of the railroads still sought an avenue where a formal process of negotion, mediation and arbitration could be sought. In 1926, RLA was passed to formalize this process and in 1934, the National Mediation Board, NMB, was created to oversee this process with airline workers being tacked on with an amendment in 1936. This approach of direct government intervention in company-union affairs has created issues for mostly the workers.

**The Process**

This formal path of negotion has given airlines and railroads the ultimate poison pill will contract negotions. Under RLA, a union group can only appeal to the NLRB if they believe the company is not negotiating in good faith. It's then down to a series of federally mandated mediators, arbitrators, which are appointed by the NMB, to step in. Should all of that fail, which 99% of the time, the union membership becomes exhausted from negotiating and accepts the crap the company doles out, the President has tbe authority to form a ""Presidential Emergency Board"" which then will hand down a contract for the membership and company(ies). This ends the negotion and both sides are by law, required to accept the contract. This process normally takes years and negotions can stalemate at any point causing even further delays.

**Why This Matters**

The thing about the railroad dispute of 2022 was that was a rare case where a dispute made it to the oval office. The Presidential Emergency Board met and declared they were handing a new contract for congressional approval. So what were the major wins? 20% pay raises, 1 extra sick day off and a handful of other fringe benefits. The pay raise didn't even keep up with inflation, despite the conservatives media touting railroad workers were the highest they've ever been paid. After the pathetic contracts were awarded, a massive exodus of the industries most experienced railroaders left, citing the deal as an insult. [6] That same year, railroad executives had a banner year for compensation.

Meanwhile in the Airline sector, a slew of new contracts have been ratified in the last 3 years by all major carriers (Delta, United, American and lastly, Southwest). These contracts had some lucrative pay raises for select working groups, mainly pilots and flight attendants but the years of endless negotion, especially during a time of unprecedented inflation, still cost the working groups in union dues and lost higher wages. Meanwhile, Executives continued to take home 7-8 figure bonuses. 

RLA takes away the fundamental right of a union to engage in our most powerful collective action: striking. The heart of my argument is this: *If a working group is not allowed to walk off the job, they're collective bargaining power is effectively erased.* 

Even without meaningful strike action, this doesn't mean we can't picket or raise awareness of the issues we're facing. ""Informational Picketing"" is used in high visibility locations (airline terminals) but it must not impact daily operations of the airline. Work slowdowns, sudden sickouts, sit downs and other commonly used strategies are **illegal** under RLA without prior authorization and are considered ""wildcat strike actions"". The NLRB can only authorize a strike action. This ties the hands of the union and they're effectively left with no options.

**Repeal RLA**

American transportation workers deserve better. I've seen enough abuse of my fellow coworkers time, energy, schedules, confinement to hot, jet fume laden aircraft cabins. Strikes are not meant to be pleasant and while your travel planning will have to now take into consideration this factor, ultimately, the American people need to choose solidarity as a class. For anyone arguing that allowing transportation workers to strike would be too disruptive to American commerce and infrastructure, I ask why is it in the UK and EU, those transportation workers are allowed to strike and yet, they're infrastructure and commerce are considered to be world leading? I want to challenge anyone who took the time to read all of this, write to your local congressional representatives and senators and ask that RLA be repealed.

I lived in a company that provides services, in this part it is divided into two parts: the administration and the part that performs the service itself. I was in a position where I provided the service, I was just below the Manager, having several perks such as my own office and control over what I do during the day. I have these tasks to deliver and I'm gradually doing them, having a lot of free time between these activities and trying to study for the exams. I was offered a position at ADM that seemed good, with better pay, a better role... In general, this was a good proposal. The thing about x is, that's not what happened at all. I was there and started from the basics of the basics of the basics. Doing something that even someone who has never worked, if it was explained once or twice, would do. ODS: I had several responsibilities where I was, and now I just enjoy the role and that's it But what broke my will was the salary that would remain the same, would not increase and the prospects in the sector, it was discussed and the expectations for me there were zero. However, at ADM I could be relocated more easily. But this way, I could climb steps faster but with a smaller reward too. And that's what they told me, but I asked to vote where I was and I got it. But now that I got it, My father said I didn't do it right and he had to go back to the manager because I was comfortable there. And now I feel wrong again."

My boss, who is in charge of the onboarding process, is insanely scatterbrained and disorganized and just...chaotic. She is always behind on everything, by a lot. So basically what happens is we will hire somebody and they will start before all their pre-hire things are complete. So she will have me run background checks and call previous employers on people that have been working there for a month haha. Normally it isn't so bad because they are 'field' workers that aren't in the office with us. But the most recent time this happened, it was for our new office coworker whose desk was literally 12 feet away! I told her this seemed like a very awkward task, and she just told me to do it quietly."

Up until now we wore all black. I liked it. I like wearing black in general so it made me feel comfortable and like I was able to express myself a bit more because I like more kind of witchy dark cottagecore stuff so it kinda worked.

Now they're enforcing a new dress code and it's going to be mandatory to wear blue jeans (and later they're planning to introduce white shirts too). Blue is not my colour and I haven't worn jeans in a decade. I don't like jeans, I don't like the way they look and the way they feel on my body. I've bought two pairs of trousers for work and both of them were more on a fancy side, just because I like dressing nicely and I don't like jeans. And the examples of what is accepted just look so ugly and basic... not to mention all the spills, dirt etc. from work are going to be twice as visible on the new clothes since some of our shops deal with food/beverages prep and catering.

I guess all the alt people who are here will resonate with my pain too lol. I'm thinking my only option will be to go full on pin up vintage rockabilly just to help myself hate this new dress code a little less.

But whatever. There's a chance I'll have to quit in a few months anyway, for unrelated reasons. With all the crap I've had to deal with while working for this company, it feels any kind of inconvenience or issue could become a final straw for me at this point and an excuse to leave."

Work a desk job in financial services. We get a informal review every quarter with one official end of year review.

The quarterly one usually is just a talk with your boss saying the usual thing like current progress what needs to improve on. 

I've been with the firm for over two years and had a bunch of these which were pretty much 1v1 meetings. Nothing noteworthy.

This time they said my performance was faltering below the expected standards. Like not being attentive enough to details etc. They even wrote the problems this quarter on paper saying that these problems had to be addressed as soon as possible. There is no deadline or PIP form for me to sign. 

This is really a first I got written up for just a quarter check. I feel really discouraged to work now. If they have to put it in writing, I feel they did it to justify dismissing me later or something. Having this stuff is never for your benefit.

I feel even if it wasn't a formal PIP per say I think I really am finished here. I wish the job market wasn't so awful at the moment. It's a pain staying here knowing the noose is tightening."

My manager is switching their days to Mon-Wed and tells me subtly to match their schedule. 

They changed their in-office days a couple times (Mon-Wed-Fri > Mon-Wed > Tues-Thur) in the past due to personal engagements (related to their hobby) after work and both times I’ve accommodated. I have already made my own personal engagements to work around the current Tu-Th schedule, and now I feel obligated to change again.

The Sr Manager that they report to always did Mon-Wed and never cared what days we go in, as long as we’re there on Wednesdays for our team meeting. And somehow Manager was fine with only seeing Sr Manager 2x/week when we did Tu-Th. And we’ve been on this schedule for almost a year now.

Manager says it’s up to me but whenever this topic comes up they tell me that it’s good to be in the office together. I know it’s good for rapport and easier to work on projects in person, but they don’t even talk to me or acknowledge my presence on most days. Idk why it matters to them so much. I’m slightly annoyed Manager only thinks about themselves and I feel like I’m being micromanaged (in other ways too but won’t get into that).

2,2024-07-12,Another Incompetent Manager Story,u/Rachel_Salt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1hxaw/another_incompetent_manager_story/,antiwork,"So, I (33F), started at my new company a little over a year ago. I'd been told that the manager was mean and incompetent, but figured there was little difference between one mean and incompetent manager and another, when the new job had a much better work/life balance.

My training was an acceptable level of bumpy, due to lean staffing and the manager not truly knowing how to do the job I was hired for, as there were enough good coworkers for me to learn what I needed. Shortly after my training was considered finished, though, others started to leave. 

One person, hired a couple weeks after I was, left within 6 months. Two or so months ago, a coworker with 13 years experience in the role puts in their notice, and is forced to stay for 8 weeks because of internal transfer rules. A couple weeks ago, a different coworker went on maternity leave that's a minimum of 8 weeks (honestly, I hope she can take more). Then, just this week, another coworker with 7 years of experience puts in their notice, too. This all adds up to a bad time for everyone.

As mentioned above, the manager for our group doesn't actually know how to do our jobs. They are unable to step in to finish most things. We do rather technical work that frequently requires travel by car (company-provided, at least) that then necessitates detailed technical reports. They are so out of touch with what we do that they can't even delegate specific tasks.

For example, a coworker has been tasked with delegating the work that comes in for the person on maternity leave. The manager doesn't know enough to even do that much, even when it's all been organized in a way of, ""one person gets everything for these two weeks, then a different person gets it.""

On top of the incompetence, though, they have a mercurial and vindictive personality. They have grudges on at least two of my remaining coworkers, with clearly documented instances of retaliation. They were directly cited to be the reason that 2 people left before I started, and why the 3 people are leaving since I started. I have been keeping records of notable incidents of either incompetence or aggression; I've been thrown under the bus before, and know how important documentation is.

Fortunately, all of this is occurring in a unionized facility. All incidents have been reported to both HR and the union officials. Others before me started with just going to the manager's boss, but that did absolutely nothing. There have been some informal talks with the union and management, but the one official meeting was cancelled because management gave the union the wrong time/date/location information for that one. A new one is currently being scheduled so we can air our grievances with a union rep present. Then we just have to hope that our union still has enough teeth to actually do something about the situation.

TLDR: An incompetent and vindictive manager gets away with it for years, forcing many people to leave, and leaves the remaining coworkers to pick up the pieces."

I am NOT a full time worker, yet a supervisor from a different facility to mine asked me to work another 5 hour shift on the weekend. I told her no because I am not open to working 6 days a week or full time. 

I may have considered it if I were told weeks in advance.

The worst part is my mom works at this other facility, and for context, she does not have custody of me. She told her supervisor I would be available on weekends. The hell? Stay out of my business.

806,2024-07-12,HR Is a Major Reason I Left Management,u/ITrCool,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1jxi7/hr_is_a_major_reason_i_left_management/,antiwork,"HR is part of the reason I got out of management. I worked IT for 18 years and five of those years was in management. 

I had amazing employees on my team. Best guys and gals someone could ask for and I really enjoyed being down in the trenches with them while we all got stuff done. I took the “whatever you need, tell me, even if you just need to vent” approach to it. I HATE micromanaging so I didn’t want to be that for them either. 

Anyway, layoffs happened, company went stagnant and focused on stock price, so naturally tons of people burned out and left for other jobs during the tech hiring boom of 2021.

The whole IT department is down from 40 people to just 7, 5 of which are my team. We are a core IT team for the whole company. Vital to its operations. 

I leverage this as their manager and work my butt off to give them high ratings and generous raises. Because they more than deserve it with all they put up with and do while keeping good attitudes and teamwork alive. 

Director approves and everyone above approves……but it never makes it to the VP’s desk. Why?

Freaking HR blocks it and says I have to “give ratings on a bell curve.” Meaning I have to INTENTIONALLY give some employees lower ratings so HR doesn’t have to approve too many generous raises because “budgetary issues”. (Yet other public facing teams or C-Suite are handed generous raises and perks anyway)

I protest and point this out and am sternly warned that this is the company rule and I have no choice. I protest further and the director of HR gets on the horn with me and tells me it’s this or it’s my job. That is the choice I have in the matter. 

I resigned for another job that same month. My team all eventually resigned and move on too. Company left in a lurch and had to outsource our jobs in a mad hurry to keep from collapsing. Eventually they were bought out by a larger firm. 

HR is indeed a cancer to company growth and employee happiness and career growth at most times. It’s sad. "

I am not young (I am 44) and I have been in my industry since college. I have never been in a lay off environment and its been a major, major wakeup call. I am off today and just wanted to see other people's experiences.

Anyway, my company, who is ethically challenged on a GOOD day has begun lay offs. Why they are doing this makes them sound even worse, so I can leave that detail out. Just based on first round its clear that life is not fair and they are getting rid of excellent and hardworking people. And the scumbags will survive until the end. I never would have worked for this company, but they bought out my prior company 1-2 years ago.

Anyway, I survived the first round, which I am told was 10% of our workforce.

But the sitting every day- working harder than ever- combined with the sheer anxiety and the feeling of STUPIDITY that I feel for being ""depressed"" at my age is kind of embarrassing. The economy is generally very, very rough in terms of finding positions so its pretty daunting. I have started a list of my contacts, asked for recommendations from the few people left I can trust-- as if I am blindsided, I want to be somewhat prepared. 

As the lay offs are NOT based on performance at all (I am a top performer) but based on a few other specifics that I will not go into. My chances of being employed by years end are 35%-50%. And sadly, my team has some real lowlifes which makes it even harder to watch good folks get cut.

Is it normal to feel major anxiety/sleepless nights over being in a layoff environment? When I should feel grateful that I still have a position? 

I was warned by some close friends for years, that I devoted too much of my life to my job, and now I know they were right. (Its always been 60-70 hours, otherwise you could never make enough to survive)"

After reading it, I found several points that I believe will have an impact. Do you think these changes will benefit businesses, or will they affect workers' benefits?

* Allow workers to accumulate paid time off. Lower- and middle-income workers are more likely be in jobs that are subject to overtime laws that require employers to pay time-and-a-half for working more than 40 hours a week. **- helps workers**
* Congress should enact the Working Families Flexibility Act. The Working Families Flexibility Act would allow employees in the private sector the ability to choose between receiving time-and-a-half pay or accumulating time-and-a-half paid time off (a choice that many public sector workers already have). For example, if an individual worked two hours of overtime every week for a year, he or she could accumulate four weeks of paid time off to use for paid family leave, vacation, or any reason. **- helps workers**
* Congress should encourage communal rest by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)9 to require that workers be paid time and a half for hours worked on the Sabbath. That day would default to Sunday, except for employers with a sincere religious observance of a Sabbath at a different time (e.g., Friday sundown to Saturday sundown); the obligation would transfer to that period instead. Houses of worship (to the limited extent they may have FLSA-covered employees) and employers legally required to operate around the clock (such as hospitals and first responders) would be exempt, as would workers otherwise exempt from overtime. **- helps workers**
* Congress should clarify that overtime for telework applies only if the employee exceeds 10 hours of work in a specific day (and the total hours for the week exceed 40).  **- does not help workers in Alaska, California, Nevada, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands** **all have daily overtime laws for working over eight hours in a day.**
* DOL should clarify that a home office is not subject to OSHA regulations and that time to set up a home office is not compensable time or eligible for overtime calculations. DOL should likewise clarify that reimbursement for home office expenses is not part of an employee’s regular rate, even if those reimbursements are repetitive (such as for internet or cell phone service). **- minimum impact**
* DOL should maintain an overtime threshold that does not punish businesses in lower-cost regions (e.g., the southeast United States). The Trump-era threshold is high enough to capture most line workers in lower-cost regions. One possibility to consider (likely requiring congressional action) would be to automatically update the thresholds every five years using the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) as an inflation adjustment. This could reduce the likelihood of a future Administration attempting to make significant changes but would also impose more adjustments on businesses as those automatic increases take hold. - **not familiar with**
* Congress should clarify that the “regular rate” for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided. This would enable employers to offer additional benefits to employees without fear that those benefits would dramatically increase overtime pay. **- help workers by having more benefits**
* Congress should provide flexibility to employers and employees to calculate the overtime period over a longer number of weeks. Specifically, employers and employees should be able to set a two- or fourweek period over which to calculate overtime. This would give workers greater flexibility to work more hours in one week and fewer hours in the next and would not require the employer to pay them more for that same total number of hours of work during the entire period. **- does not help workers**
* Congress should amend the NLRA to authorize collective bargaining to treat national employment laws and regulations as negotiable defaults. For example, this reform would allow a union to bless a relaxed overtime trigger (e.g., 45 hours a week, or 80 hours over two weeks) in exchange for firm employer commitments on predictable scheduling  **- does not help workers**

2,2024-07-12,IT Work Is Awful and Makes Me Depressed.,u/EbonyDragonFire,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1lcmo/it_work_is_awful_and_makes_me_depressed/,antiwork,"Hi, I work for an IT department for the federal government in Tier II, onsite support. I get paid very well to do this job so maybe I don't have room to complain, but IT work makes me incredibly unhappy so I came her to vent my antiwork.

I used to be Army Guard doing IT so I have already been doing IT work for almost 6-7 years. I joined this IT job a couple years before I got out of the guard, I got fun double-fisiting for awhile.

When people think of what IT work is about or like, they usually think of funny ha-hah memes like, ""Did you turn it on and off again?"" and ""You don't know how to open a PDF?!"".

But I think a lot of times, no one talks about how mentally taxing it is. Everyone you work with, co-workers, managers, and customers, are all different. Your co-workers and bosses work between either being total shitbags, ""super-hooah"" or laid back. Your customers could be so nice and refreshing that they make your day and shower you in candy. And some of them are the deciding factor on how crappy you are going to feel until you punch out. The best and worst customers are the ones who are doctors or high-ranking (or high priority) people.

Just yesterday, I had a customer who caused me to stay 30 minutes late after my shift at 4:30 PM. (Yeah I know, I could have it harder, I know some of you had stayed much longer after your shifts. I understand.)

So our policy is that we only work on equipment IT or the department provided. We have a strict NO POE troubleshooting policy. The exception is if they use a POE computer with a virtual desktop, it goes to a separate IT group we don't touch. But this guy put in a ticket with issues with his USB-connected camera. In his ticket he did not mention anything about his camera being personally bought. So I exhausted everything I could think of. Often times, we run into a wall where our government computers are just so locked down that drivers just break and refuse to resolve. At this point, I say we should look into other options and the customer admits that he bought this camera with his own money because the gov takes too long to procure them. Unfortunately this triggers our POE rules.

So I instated those rules and what we can and can't do. Of course, this makes him upset and he starts debating with me, saying I can replace the camera or still fix this issue. Even going as far as telling me to give him recommendations of a new camera to buy, which we are also not authorized to do.

I finally am able to get him off the phone once I said I will bring my boss into the equation to see what he says. I was hoping at this point the boss would hear my word of the day, POE, and talk to him to get him off my back.

Unfortunately that's not what happened. Instead of following our rules, he went the opposite and bent them and reached out to the user saying I would further help him revert some installs and run some things to see if those fix the issue.

I know that IT is about customer services, but how do I provide GOOD customer service when my bosses just one-up me when I followed the rules I was told to follow? Now I just look like an ass for doing what I was told and the customer is going to turn around and be like, ""See, she CAN do XYZ. She just doesn't want to!"" and this teaches customers that they can get what they want by being louder.

Nothing good came out of it.

* The customer was mean and resistive
* He got what he wanted because of his title
* My manager did not back me up
* The treatment towards me was not addressed with the customer or their boss
* Now I look like an ass
* Now I have I have to keep working with a guy who treated me poorly

I fucking hate IT work. I just want a happy little existence gardening, anything with plants really, or something artsy. I don't have the room to be risky, have job changes or go to colleges because I am the head of household and my job does not support partial work-weeks for college (because you should already have a degree to work here).

So if any of you are working with IT for some reason, whether it be at your job or at home, please think about the impact of your words. I've talked to some internet reps for my home internet and some of them were so grateful for my patience that I was actually given prorated bills for internet because they were just relieved to have a nice customer for 30 minutes.

Again, I know I am fortunate to have a good paying job, but that does not mean I am happy. I do not need to hear the ""Welcome to adulthood"" BS. Being treated like shit is not in my job description. And I am so socially anxious. I WANT to make the customer happy. But when I know they're not going to be, I struggle and feel awful."

I say merged in quotation because the reality is we were bought out and the company that fucking cannibalized us proceeded to liquidate our division over the next six months.

The company being absorbed was completely erased. Positions were eliminated. Most of the responsibilities were distributed to employees of the company taking over. So most of us quit and found other jobs, and the economy/jobs market in this state isn't great compared to the big cities. The new job I got is not quite comparable to what I had before. Pays a bit less, not near as much responsibility. I am very unmotivated because I don't have as much to do. This merger kicked my ass.

And so I am dealing with the disappointment and frustration of everything that happened. I feel like my career has been sabotaged and I will **never** get back to where I was in terms of pay and responsibility."

48,2024-07-12,What is the fucking deal with managers being so contrarian?,u/IT_VI,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1ljit/what_is_the_fucking_deal_with_managers_being_so/,antiwork,"I swear to god, my manager always has to immediately disagree with me no matter what it is I'm saying. Even if I am asking a question with a this or that answer, I end up getting a third response or ""No.""

It's to the point that I can almost game the system where I can respond to a coworker's question with an answer my manager gave previously, and Manager will respond and *contradict his previous answer.* So if there is a procedure I don't care for or think is poorly thought out, I can just make sure to bring up, ""Oh, Manager mentioned we need to do XYZ,"" and within minutes, he responds with a different opinion.

There are two recent examples that I feel really show this. One was related to after hours work when requested by project owners. Obviously, like most companies, we try to minimize OT including by rejecting meetings outside of our working hours. We'd also been told that we aren't beholden to participate in last minute meetings (IE receiving invites day-of) to dissuade other departments treating us as always available, on-demand service.

I received a meeting invite at 3PM local time to join a meeting at 5PM local time, which is when I go off the clock. I'm also the last person online, so my other coworkers were even further off the clock than I'd be. It was the first one we'd had in a while, so I messaged the group asking to confirm that I could reject the meeting and reschedule.

Manager responds that, unless I had an appointment, then I should join the call. The call is also during ""standard"" office hours for our company, just not our department. I *will* get OT (at least), but unless I had something pressing, I should make every effort to join. I didn't have anything to do, so I made the meeting. ""We should only reject meetings in cases where we're just absolutely slammed.""

Last week, we had the same situation; we're sent an invitation for 4PM at about 10AM. A coworker pops up this time asking if we are expected to take it, so I reply: ""Yes, Manager said that as long as we aren't doing something else, we need to make every effort to join these. You'll just get OT to do so."" Not 2 minutes later, Manager responds saying he's reaching out to the customer to ask them to reschedule, citing OT as problematic and that it's not acceptable to be ""sent a last minute request."" Right.

The other example is much more minor, but still frustrating. I've got three projects in my queue waiting on authorization, so I asked my manager if I should expect auth to come in today or Monday. He replied ""No, it will be sometime next week."" I say no problem. He responds, ""I'll be sending auth for 1 and 2 today."" Okay... so the answer was ""Today, with the exception of 3."" Why did you have to instantly say ""No?""

These situations are pretty minor, but were easy to explain. There are several instances that were much higher stakes. I've even had situations where in a DM about how to handle a customer, I get one answer, then when I reply to the customer with theatanswer, my manager steps in and undermines me publicly. *Even though I just said what he told me to,* he finds a reason why it wasn't ""correct"" or adds another caveat that wasn't explained.

Is this some sort of management strategy? Is it an ego thing? It feels awfully close to negging or even gaslighting (at least in the situations where I'm publicly reprimanded). My last manager did it too, but much less frequently. It's almost comical how quickly I can get him to change his mind just by saying the opposite of what I think should happen.

Note: Most of our job duties don't require manager involvement whatsoever, but we've been going through layoffs and consolidations lately resulting in new job descriptions and responsibilities. Eventually (I hope) these will be worked out, but we still have a lot of changes we have to address individually until we finally get official procedures done. Trial and error and all that."

It's been a long process of sticking though soul sucking work. I started as an apprentice for 2 years, became a journeyman for 2 years, and now I have been a superintendent for 2 years. I absolutely dread every single day of the last 6 years but only continued for the money. Last couple years I've been edging the 6 figure mark and that has at least allowed me to pay off the majority of debts. 

I truly feel this line of work has sucked the enjoyment out of my life. I commute 4 hours a day on top of working 8-12 hrs. There hasn't been any time for anything other then the bare necessities and only for the bare minimum rewards. 

I'm scared to quit though as I see the market isn't great right now and prices are rising. I don't have a job lined up yet and my window for quiting on decent terms is growing closer(at the end of my current project). I don't even know if a lateral move to something else is possible and I'm almost guaranteed to take a large pay cut. Though it's something that I am willing to do to better my life. 

Do you guys have any ideas on how to make this transition work more in my favor? I'm looking to leave the industry and work closer to home. One of my options is to start a business of my own but idk if it's the best time to risk something like that.

She told me a story once that she was watching the cameras at another gyms location and watched one of the employees sit down for hours and “scratch his balls every 10 minutes” she acted like this was funny and told me she texted the gyms manager to make him get up and work.

6,2024-07-12,Employer has completely changed my job role - 6 months in,u/K3Z1CH,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1p0qp/employer_has_completely_changed_my_job_role_6/,antiwork,"I took on a new role around the beginning of this year as an advisor, the job role was described as a mixture of bookings administrator, client advisor and a little bit of sales. I applied, having never worked in sales but confident that I had transferable skills that applied to the bulk of the role. 

1st interview went well, explained multiple times that I have never worked in sales and have no desire to be a classic ‘salesperson’ as that’s just not what I’m looking for in a job. ‘That’s fine! It’s not really sales it’s more customer service!’ they said. 

2nd interview I was tasked with creating a presentation which I thought was a little excessive but this company looked really good, the team looked happy and their social media reflected this. So I did the presentation and got the job. 

I’ve been working there for a few months now and despite some weird vibes it’s been fine! I realised after my first few weeks that everything was not as it seemed from the outside looking in - staff turnover was alarmingly high (most citing a ‘toxic’ culture) and a few months after I started there was a few big changes in operations such as paying for our own milk for tea and coffee and axing the team building days that they have been holding for years. The advertisement said they were flexible, but actually offered 0 flexibility, not even 30 minutes. Little did I know that was just the beginning. 

I walk into work on Monday morning to be greeted by what I can only describe as a parody of Leonardo DiCaprio in the Wolf of Wall Street. Arrogance oozes out of this man, he stinks of cigarettes and is just wholly abrasive and an entire galaxy away from the ‘values’ supposedly held by the business. 
He’s been brought in by the Directors (with no warning might I add) to optimise sales and scale the business. 

Every morning we have had to sit and listen to this man chat absolute shit about his personal life in the spirit of ‘learning to sell like the wolf of wall street’ which is a job I didn’t even sign up for! He plans to turn our lunch room into a cold calling centre, no doubt utilising scalped data from god knows where, with no consultation with the team on where we will actually go to eat our lunch and enjoy our 30 minute unpaid break in peace!

All week we have been told there will be a meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the teams thoughts - everyone in the office is in complete shock - the meeting never materialised, instead we were sent an email with questions to reply to in the style of ‘What have you learned this week’ ‘How will this help you in your personal life.’ Well it won’t help me much because now I need to look for a new job! 

I’m in semi disbelief that these people believe that hiring someone for one role and then switching up on them not even 6 months into their employment with no consultation is in any way professional or acceptable, but then that’s employers for you I guess! Im lucky in the sense that I don’t need the job, but my lovely colleagues unfortunately are not. Just another example of shitty human beings - as if I haven’t come across enough of them in my working life. "

I am managing a gym in a small company with less than 10 locations. The area manager over my gym location a few others was visiting as well as the vice president of the company. The area manager began telling me a story about how she was watching the cameras at a different gyms location and noticed one of the male employees sitting down for a while. So she decides to sit down and watch him for an HOUR. 

She said he would “scratch his balls every ten minutes” and she just sat there and watched it acting like he was the weird one. Both the area manager and the vice president found this funny and were laughing. It felt weird to me and made me feel violated for the poor guy. Why are you stalking employees like this? She was not even at work when she was watching the cameras she was watching them for entertainment in her house.

She also threatened to write me up for having DND on outside of work hours when I am not on call and I am paid hourly. 

After these two things happening I am quitting. I’m done with this weird company.

1,2024-07-12,Am I crazy for hating this place?,u/Equivalent-Ad-2576,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1q506/am_i_crazy_for_hating_this_place/,antiwork,"I recently started this new job, being a host at this restaurant. (Keep in mind i’ve been a waitress before so my goal was to host at this place for a little bit and move up to waitressing here because i love waitressing!!) 

1. My first day at this job the managers threw me up at the host stand with 3 other girls, one was also in her 3rd day of training and the other two have been working there for 2 months plus. This girl, who has been at this restaurant for 9 months was supposed to train me. She didn’t say a word to me almost my whole shift. Till the end when she showed me how to clean a bathroom. It was to the point where the girl who was on her third day of training started training me.

2. This place has about 5 million different managers that are all supposed to be responsible for different things. There’s the GM, head chef, bar manager, and a party manager, about 2 front of house managers. Yet  this place is so poorly managed because all of them are on completely different pages and tell all of us normal employees different things which you can imagine leads to a lot of confusion. 

3. immediately noticed one of the front house mangers is legitimately crazy. they constantly are up at the host stand critiquing everything we do. forces us to wipe windows over and over again after they were just wiped. basically does our job for us as well. doesn’t give us much of a chance to even greet guests which is fine whatever but leaves all of us feeling like this manager thinks we can’t do our job. It almost feels like this manager undermines us. Let’s call them manager 1

manager 1 confronted me saying that I was purposely skipping this servers section and telling customers they don’t want to sit there. 
(Keep in mind this section is just a terrible section to be in, it consists of 3 high top tables half booth half chair, and 2 large round tables that are for parties of 5-8. One of these high tops, and one of the large round tables is very close to the swinging kitchen door. Countless times i’ve walked customers to those tables and they immediately said no we don’t want to sit here because of the kitchen doors. I am not allowed to tell them no so I have to go back to the host stand and find a new table for them. Leaving this server screwed. Also when customers come in I have to ask if they want to sit inside or outside and then if we are going to sit them at a high top I was trained to ask if a hightop was okay. Since it is summer customers more often are saying outside, and majority of the time say no to a high top. This restaurant also only has 5 booths and the amount of times customers come in and immediately ask for a booth is insane.) 
So back to the story, manager 1 accused me of skipping this servers section and said how upsetting it is because they aren’t making money. my response was i agree i think it’s very annoying but i’ve tried to sit multiple tables there and majority of them ask to go somewhere else. I then said and a lot of customers are asking for booths, if there’s open booths am I supposed to tell them no? (This was a genuine question because they complain about this stuff all time and I whole heartedly have no idea what the want from me when customers are requesting certain things I was always taught to accommodate them no matter what) This manager said well no of course not, just make sure you’re seating this section. This whole interaction rubbed me the wrong way because instead of storming up here accusing me of not seating this section why couldn’t you have came up here and said “hey was going on, what are customers asking for tonight?” and i could’ve told you most of them want to sit outside or in a booth or requesting low tables hence why this server isn’t getting sat. Like everyone says it’s not what you’re saying it’s how you say it.

  4. We got super busy the other night and this place wants open menu counts all the time and also started a paper rotation sheet on top of the tablet rotation so I was trying to keep up with the paper rotation sheet and I pulled up the calculator on my phone to add some number: together my GM was standing there and immediately was like no phones, i replied back I’m just using my calculator for this they said i don’t care no phones if I let you have a phone then I have to make exceptions for everyone. Keep in mind this manager was up at the host stand USING THEIR PHONE THE WHOLE TIME ON FACEBOOK! Regardless of that I said ok whatever. My coworker that was hosting with me went to go do an open menu count and pulled out her phone and was using her calculator… I said oh GM said no phones she said oh he said I was fine to use it… Immediately pissed me off because what. This GM picks favorites like no tomorrow it’s actually terrible. There was also an incident where these customers walked in and said they had about 15-20 people so I also choose the higher number to be safe we seat them and whatever well the server who was serving them came up to the host stand and said isn’t that table that just got sat mine? My GM was like no your head count is higher than another server so it’s hers. This server who was questioning this was like well no that 20 top was only an 8 top. that was my first time hearing that, the whole night. Of course my GM looks at me and is like that’s your job to change that yada yada. I just said ok. I WOULDVE CHANGED IT IF SHE CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT BUT SHE WAITED LIKE 2 HOURS TO SAY SOMETHING?????? 

5. another story with manager 1, they came up to me and said oh we have to talk to guests when we seat them so I started doing that I would seat them and talk to them at their table about our specials and whatever. I came back and manager 1 asked if i talked to them I said yes. Then manager 1 said ok talk to them while you walk them to their table. I said “ok…” I don’t get why it has to be while I walk them, as I’m focused on making sure I don’t bump into a server or a food runner or a customer and also I enjoy eye contact when I’m talking to customers and I can’t do that while I’m walking them to their table because I’m trying to avoid accidents. This restaurant also is so hard to hear at, the play the music so loud and it is a restaurant so loud music added to people talking doesn’t make the best for talking to customers while I’m walking to their tables hosts are also supposed to have an ear piece in connected to a walkie talkie and that limits my hearing as well so i take it out when i’m talking to customers but they just yelled at us about that the other day 😁 but I said ok. So i went to walk these people to their table and I waited to start talking once we left the host stand a little more and I turned around a few times and asked them basic questions like have we been here before yada yada and sat them down and continued my whole spew about a menu item. Well i get back to the host stand sure enough Manager 1 is grilling me “did you talk them” yes.. “no you didn’t i didn’t see you talk to them while you walked them” yes I did? i asked them if theyve been here before… “well clearly they didn’t hear you because you have your back to them” I just wanted this conversation to end so I said ok. At this point I was so fed up, I don’t like being told I didn’t do something when I did do what I was told to do. It so frustrating. Another complaint with manager 1 is they talk down to all of us hosts like we’re stupid and I also don’t like that. Every time there’s a critique it’s always so aggressive and just makes everyone upset.

I have plenty more of complaints but this is already long enough 😭 I genuinely want to quit so bad because being a host is not a hard job whatsoever it’s all the managers making it so complicated. Would you guys be fed up with this place or just me?"
1,2024-07-12,first job / losing hope,u/myangelhood,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1q52c/first_job_losing_hope/,antiwork,"17. First job at taco bell has been rough so far. They didn’t train me at all and they also didn’t properly train one of my manager.  I’m being so literal when i say they’ve never showed me any of the training videos or anything. It has been 3 weeks. 

They’re too understaffed to fire anybody. Within my first week my coworker started harassing a customer for no reason, he followed her out to her car and called the police on her. someone told me it was the third time he did something like that. He then got fired for something unrelated to the harassment. I don’t even wanna know what it takes to get fired from this place. 

My one coworker doesn’t wear deodorant and he yells and swears at me when i make a mistake. He regularly goes in the walk-in to punch the wall when he’s mad. Now he’s yelling at me when i ask questions too. I accidentally created one more dirty dish for him than i should have and he has been meaner since. Last shift i told him “please don’t speak to me like that” and said something along the lines of that he could use his normal voice. He didn’t really respond at all. 

I already have some PTSD going on and it’s just too fucking hard to be walking on eggshells both at home and work. I don’t like how they treat me when i make a mistake. It’s not the end of the fucking world. I want to make life easier for everyone but it’s impossible to remember all the shit i’m supposed to do when i’m getting snapped at from every direction. 

I’m too scared to quit because it took me MONTHS of applying to anywhere entry-level to find a job that actually looks at their applications. I’m doing my gen-eds at a CC but don’t want to go to university yet because i’m not sure what i want to do. plus i want to go to school abroad but have to pick a country. I wish i liked myself enough to just let myself have a semester of no work or classes. 

All i want is to have some mindless part-time work to do in a non-hostile environment while i figure out the rest of my life so that i don’t feel like a lazy piece of shit for not working. Is that so much to fucking ask? I’m such an idiot for expecting a work environment to serve the purpose of being a place where people treat me like a fucking human being. I’m not gonna make it. "

And I told him that with 37 million you only work if you're crazy in the head. Then I said that we had money to buy basically everything and anything, to live life seriously, to never worry about money or work again.

I'm only having people get back to me by looking on Indeed/Google Jobs and then placing my application directly with the company, WITH a bit of research to make sure I'm not applying to fake companies.

Why should I as a candidate have to put up with all of this bullshit? If we live in a capital society, why are there no concrete laws on how to respect candidate time?

And remember kids, we don't befriend coworkers because they throw you under the bus most of the time. But because coworkers are people and people are someone's coworkers, people are also the devil.

Quickly vacuum or soak it up so we don't get ants. Someone leaves urine on the toilet seat? Wipe it off so the next person can use it. I am not fine with vacuuming each room, wiping off the windows and mirrors, scrubbing the sinks, toilets, and bathroom floors, and dusting every surface. I have arachnophobia, and we have spiders in every corner because I'm too scared to clean there. I would not have taken this job if I knew I would be responsible for them, or any of my other cleaning duties.

I spoke to my boss about how I felt misled by the job listing and by his wording when describing my duties. He brought up that we can't afford a janitor, and proceeded to call me out on everything I do wrong. The studio is disgusting. I'm on my phone or reading at my desk (even though a large part of administrative work is waiting around and just generally being available. Me doing these things during my downtime has never interfered with my ability to help people.)

He decided to ""strike a deal"" with me. The two things I hated most were the spiders and scrubbing the bathroom floors, so he said he would take them on instead. Neither of these things have been done ONCE since we had this conversation. There are more spiders than ever and the bathroom floors are sticky and discolored. Every day the building becomes more filthy because I'm sick of doing this. This isn't what I signed up for, and it's not what I'm paid for either ($12 an hour).

I want to quit, but I worry that no other job would allow me flexibility with my schedule that this job does. I am also a professional opera singer (it does not pay enough to live off of), and my job is okay with me taking off several hours early for rehearsals and performances. I don't want to give up on opera, it's my passion, but if I got a new job, they might force me to.

I don't know what to do at this point."

8,2024-07-12,Interview,u/sorrowful_nomad,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1s92r/interview/,antiwork,"had 4 rounds of interviews for a stupid warehouse job. I have worked in a warehouse for 4 years and was an inventory manager for 2 years. The first 3 interviews went REALLY well I feel but the last one.......

  
The final interview I met with the HR for the actual facility as well as the inventory head and they belittled me the entire time. The final straw was them telling me I'm a job hopper when i have had only 3 jobs in the last 8 years. the first one I was working in a warehouse, the 2nd was me becoming Information Technology after finishing school while I was at the warehouse job, and the 3rd one was Inventory manager. 

They talked down to me the entire time and I'm done with this work culture shit. I'm trying so damn hard to figure some kind of self employment but lack any form of confidence so I just have to sit in interviews and be treated like shit.

This is a VERY common way for candidates to be treated around my area and I'm sick of this shit. I'm just sick of being underpaid, treated like shit, burned out, and then thrown away just so some rich asshat can buy another house while I watch myself and others starve and barely be able to cling to the scraps after doing 50 to 60 hour weeks.

  
I hate hunting for a job, working a job, going to my job, coming home from my job, and EVERYTHING that has to do with working a normal 9 to 5. "

I applied to a hippie ish restaurant that repeatedly put up posts on their Instagram saying they are hiring. They said to email them, so that's what I did. It seemed like a fairly relaxed cozy cafe type setting, which I would love to work in.


They never responded to my email, so a few days later I called and asked if they were still hiring. They put me on the phone with the owner, who asked about my availability and if I would be interested in summer seasonal work or to be a long term worker. I said ""I'd be looking to be a long term worker only."" she then responded ""What do you mean SORTA?"" in a snappy tone-- to which I responded ""...I didn't say 'sorta'. I said I'd be looking for long term work?"" sounding confused. She then said ""Ohhh okay right on right on..."" and asked if I had experience. I said ""I have X amount of years in the restaurant business and I'm currently working at X (company) as a ____"" And she goes ""I'm familiar with X (company). They're very different from what we do here but I guess it's similar enough."" She then told me to email them my resume again and to put specifically I was looking for non-seasonal positions so she could separate it from the seasonal work applicants.


I was very put off by the phone conversation, but they sounded extremely busy in the back and I was having a little trouble hearing her. So I chalked it up to the loudness of the restaurant causing her confusion. Nevertheless I emailed her my resume in a very polite and professional manner, saying thanks for your consideration etc. 


In response, 2 days later at a little after 8am I got (in all lowercase) ""hi. are you available for an interview today at 2 or 3? or sunday? thanks.""


I responded 45 minutes later and agreed to go in today for the 2pm interview. Never got a response, but that's typical-- my current job that I'm working at did that as well and I still got hired. So I didn't think anything of it.


So, I rearrange all of my plans of the day to make this interview, and show up early at 1:45. Check in with a worker, say I'm here for an interview, she says shes gonna call the owner because she's not here but she's ""nearby"".



10 minutes later the worker comes over telling me ""She didn't realize she had an interview today and she didn't see your email. She said she's sorry she never saw you responded to her. She asked if you can come in on Sunday instead?"" 



I was dumbfounded because I didn't ask to interview that day, SHE asked ME for the interview. She picked the time and date and doesn't show up? And I responded only 45 MINUTES after she emailed me??? So between the hours of 8am and 2pm she never thought once to check her email to see if I responded? Wtf is that? She emails me, sets her phone down and goes ""Welp! time to not look at my emails for the rest of the day!""



So I said I'd email her and figure it out and thanked the worker and left. Half of a day later, gas wasted, energy wasted and time wasted. The owner still hasn't emailed me asking to reschedule the interview or apologizing for her ghosting me.



If she doesn't reach out, I don't think I'm going to even bother emailing her. I know the restaurant industry isn't known for its professionalism but I've experienced more professionalism from fucking Applebees for fucks sake. What would you do/say in this situation Reddit?"

Like the title says. No one hasn't get paid for a month now. The employer is always delaying the pay day saying that it is not ready or that he will go to the restaurant next week or simply saying not now. 

Previous employees had come to pick up their check and the employer has told them that if they present themselves at the restaurant, he will call the cops to make them leave at once. 

It is infuriating how this guy is treating these people like this. I got mad and went to labor department and got six forms for everyone to fill up and present them against him. 

What else can we do? I'm pretty much the leading force since I don't want this to happen to anyone and especially not my girlfriend. We will all go to labor department this Monday to present the filled up forms and see where this take us. Is there anything that I should be informed of? What are the options available? 

Thank you everyone.     "

This all starts a few months ago, when I have to move from Canada to the US to reunite with my family. I’ve been working remotely for a US company from Canada for two years, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I tell them about my move, and they are supportive. I ask what will happen to my salary, and they say that they will do a market analysis for my role in the US. As you can imagine, my pay in Canada is significantly less than my US counterparts. 

HR comes back a week later and they say that they will give me an increase/ market adjustment. It will be effective on the first day of my move. The amount they offered me was lower than what my peers make, but it was still reasonable so I took it. 

This is when shit starts to go down. Two months after I initially met with HR to discuss my salary increase, I get a random meeting invite from the HR person that was assigned to my move. She tells me that my salary increase can’t get approved, as it’s not in the budget. She explains to me that she was new at the time, and she didn’t know that the increase had to get approved by other individuals. My CAD salary will get converted to USD and that’s all they can do.

I feel blindsided. Giving me an amount, and then coming back to me two months later to tell me that I won’t get it is so terrible. Before you ask, I tried to get it in writing multiple times but the HR partner kept brushing me off/ignoring my emails. 

I am now moving in two weeks, with a salary way lower than what I was expecting. I will also be making significantly less (about 40%) than my peers in the same role, which adds a layer of humiliation. This is causing me an incredible amount of stress. 

They always used the argument that I am located in Canada to pay me less. But now that I am moving to US, I’m not even getting a dollar as a salary adjustment. Plus, I was under the impression that my salary would get adjusted for TWO MONTHS!!, until they retracted. "

I’m sentenced to 40 hours of screen staring while drinking shitty keurig coffee. Nobody hardly speaks in my office. I’m not allowed to use headphones. I get a 30 min lunch break.

8,2024-07-12,Has anyone seen the subreddit r/OptimistsUnite?,u/Okedoke231,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e1yua8/has_anyone_seen_the_subreddit_roptimistsunite/,antiwork,"It tries to come off like r/upliftingnews, but it comes feels more like “you should be grateful for breadcrumbs slave”. The amount of gaslighting on sub that everything is fine and you live in the greatest nation on earth is pretty disgusting. They also seem to heavy misinterpret data such as billions have been lifted out of poverty while leaving out the classification for poverty was “The World Bank classifies anyone living on less than $2.15 a day as living in extreme poverty.”. Even when people tried to argue in good faith they still seem to get angry at anyone who dares to question their reasoning. Here’s the link to the good faith discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1buwixw/a_polite_critique_of_this_subreddit/

When I first stumbled upon this subreddit thought it was satire, but when I looked more into it I discovered its massive cesspit of toxic positivity. A lot of the posts try to come off as positive, but to me they come off more as negative. It really comes off as a cult.

Here’s the quote from their about page:

“We are living in an age of unprecedented wealth, with millions entering the middle class every year. Homo sapiens live longer lifespans than ever before, with better nutrition, and better medicine than ever in our history. This is also the most peaceful time in our history, with record lows in crime and war deaths. The developing world is surging in wealth, and in the “west” we have more opportunity and communication than ever. Our great grandparents would trade places with us in a heartbeat.” 

I’m going to address the stuff said in the about description. 

The first point: “We are living in an age of unprecedented wealth” yes we are living in an age of unprecedented wealth right now, but most people won’t even see that wealth. 

Second point: “with millions entering the middle class every year.” last time I check millions of people were kicked out of the middle class after 2008 recession and more after the 2020 pandemic.

Third point: “Homo sapiens live longer lifespans than ever before, with better nutrition, and better medicine than ever in our history.” The life expectancy in the USA decreased by 1.8 years in 2020 then by 0.9 in 2021. There was increase in food deserts in 2020 and more people are having hard time affording nutritious foods. Don’t get me even started healthcare. While there is a lot of medicine that has become generic and cheap like tylenol or benadryl, a lot of life saving medicine is out reach for the average person in USA without good insurance. Even with good insurance you’ll still have a difficult time affording treatment.

Fourth point: “This is also the most peaceful time in our history, with record lows in crime and war deaths.” While war may not be at previous levels back then, a lot of war is undeclared under gauze of “peacekeeping” or “stabilization” in foreign countries nowadays. While some crime has been going down such as violent crime, a lot petty crime like shoplifting has been going up. War deaths while not a previous levels in the past, they have been going up due to Ukraine war and Gaza conflict. Also the US has been at war for 225 out of 243 years of its existence since 1776.

Fifth point: “The developing world is surging in wealth, and in the “west” we have more opportunity and communication than ever.” Most of the developing world has been losing wealth due to resource extraction and exploitation of the poor people from companies like Nestle. In the west opportunity has been dying as companies as companies layoff vast amounts of employees while boasting about record profits and education keeps becoming unaffordable for most people. Probably the only thing remotely close to being positive is communication, but even then a lot communication is censored and you have to great lengths to avoid surveillance by corporations and government.

Final point: “Our great grandparents would trade places with us in a heartbeat.” They would not even dare suggest that we trade places. They would be horrified and disgusted at what our society has become. If they were able utilize the knowledge they had about today’s world, they would do everything in their power to prevent life from becoming like it is today and put in all the necessary protections to make the future better for all.

Conclusion: While I’m not saying you can’t find positive aspects nowadays, but for every small positive aspect you can find a hundred big negative aspects. I not trying to come off as pessimistic, I find some positivity in being realistic and to aware of the many problems we have nowadays. If you don’t believe look at some of the posts on the subreddit and you’ll see diehard cope. That’s my opinion and what’s your opinion on it?"

Say what you want about startups vs mega corp but they’re the same thing just in different phases.

If you made it this far this is the real thing I wanted to rant about.

The worst person at EVERY COMPANY and there is one at EVERY COMPANY! Is the person whose only job is to be a fucking asshole/bitch/dick/c*** whatever you want to call them.  They just exist to intimidate vendors or senior leaders or their assistant.  They don’t DO anything except praise the ones they feel need it and intimidate the ones that don’t or that they need something from. 

I want to live in a world where you provide a service and you get to exchange that service for something else.  

THAT SERVICE cannot just be power/money/influence or whatever because you know what?!?! In this world no one has EARNED any of those things!  they’re just given out to the lucky ones!

My final ANYWAY 

I literally just didn’t want to write this down in a journal or say it to a friend. I wanted to blast it into the ether and then see if anyone could relate.  If you disagree or want to argue I won’t care or interact so just move on.   "

Plus as support I can’t dictate my schedule when requests or questions come in. I'm always having to check my email on my phone but I guess that anxiety of being ""on"" isn't enough. They also don't pay enough and without the overtime it makes it very difficult to live. When I was hired I was told there was overtime to help with that so what changed? My boss and me had a performance review and we had talked about a promotion, we had a restructure last year and ppl were asking if I was a coordinator and I had to ask then to clarify and voiced my interest in being promoted. There was no mention of a bad performance. The person who was laid off and I took over their desk (my boss was laid off too) wasn’t happy about me or the situation and I only got a desk bible and that’s it, no formal training on what a coordinator position entails at this company. I find every company is different in my industry. What I feel like what could have been a simple conversation has turned into a whole big HR thing. I’ve been here for 2 years no problems and my praises were sung. I don’t know what happened and I am starting to get the feeling there might be ulterior motives. My industry is very political too. I want to get promoted that was the whole point of this job to finally get promoted within but I'm starting to think I need to look elsewhere even if it’s at the same level and start all over again.

I was one, working indirectly for American Eagle. I loved it, the pay was okay, and we got a 40% discount on clothing so that was neat. Shortly after being hired I was promoted to second tier because I guess my ability to schmooze caught their eye. I’m a friendly, empathetic person and I would treat every customer like their issue was my issue, so the nature of the promotion - largely removing me from first line phone duty to handle more complex issues - was a little odd but whatever.

I was tasked with solving customer issues that couldn’t be fixed in one phone call. All in all pretty varied and interesting, I loved that no two problems were exactly the same. 

Cut to my trainer, I’ll call him Billy, finding out I’m a writer. He says he would never ask this and he feels so, so bad, but could I possibly write up the new version of the employee training manual? It was his job but he could obtain special permission to take me off my own duties for however long it took. I was hesitant because obviously I don’t KNOW the company policies inside and out and I told him this. 

He replied that all I needed to do was document how I personally do my job. Easy enough. 

So I get to writing. The entire thing took about two and a half regular shifts, nothing crazy. Billy loved it and promised to show the visiting CEO, a frightening, severe woman I’ll call Carla. 

Well, he showed her. But there was something wrong in his eyes when he came to speak to me after. 

Apparently I and my coworkers had unknowingly been cutting a corner in our process that violated company policy. It was not a major thing and expedited our work without causing any more problems than there would ordinarily be, but Carla did not like it. 

I was summarily put on a final warning by someone I did not even work for directly, had never spoken to, for doing something extra I’d been asked to do that wasn’t even my job. 

Well, HR was no help. They were utterly unsympathetic but in that saccharine corporate way that makes your skin crawl. 

I ended up quitting out of pure humiliation and anger, crying all the way home.  

Billy later messaged me on FB and apologized up down left and right. It wasn’t really his fault and I told him that. 

But it definitely showed me not to try to do anything extra or any favors for any company. 

The company is not your friend.  "

I’m a qualified professional authorized to work for any employer in the US, but I’m not a citizen or permanent resident (yet). 

It’s crazy how almost all applications ask if you’ll need sponsorship, and immediately send you a rejection notice if you do, it’s automatic.

I usually don’t say I need visa sponsorship, as my visa is dependent on my spouse’s, who is getting sponsorship from their employer, but screening recruiters will ask about my visa status, and even request a visa copy, on calls and through email. And a lot of job postings are advertised only for US citizens and green card holders.

As far as google research tells me, only some government, law enforcement, and other similar jobs would be justified in requesting this, and the rest is discrimination. I’ve called them out on it a couple of times and all they can say is sorry, it’s out of their hands.

I’m seriously considering starting to submit discrimination claims to a couple of regulators.

I've been robbed, shot at, towed, almost killed in a car accident, had heat stroke and hypothermia, almost got flooded out, and I've somehow managed to find a way to survive and at some points thrive- God bless doordash 2020-2021

I've had a home consistently for the past ~year and a half straight. I make $16 an hour and pay roughly 2/3 of my monthly income for housing. Rent was raised and now I have no choice but to be back on the road.

In some ways I fucking hate myself for this, but I also know that I've worked so very hard to be where I am. I've worked so very hard for it to be taken away from me. Ive discussed my situation with people at work and in my extended family and I always get the same answer ""what about asking family"" when they don't realize is some of us don't HAVE a family that cares. I have aunts who live in multi million dollar homes, grandparents who have a vacation property. I have a mom who let me live with her and forced me out when I ""turned of age.""

The only saving grace is the fact that I will be getting my bachelor's degree next spring. Maybe then I can find more than dozens of ""we're hiring!"" That aren't actually hiring or loads of part time jobs offering 6 hours a week or jobs making the same amount I already do.

I know it's not always productive to blame the job market, but I feel like I'm being cheated. $16 isn't livable anymore. But it's not like anyone cares.

I spent the last of my savings making sure my car is in good condition before I get on the road. Tonight Im sitting on the floor deciding what to keep and what the throw away. I'm dropping my cat off with a friend next week. I'm pawning my jewelry, selling my valuables. I wish someone would tell me when this will end."

I can't overstate the extent of unfriendliness and now much I was not friends or friendly with anyone. I also am cynical about corporations and work in an at-will state, every single person is replaceable at the drop of a hat and they do not give a shit about you and won't give you notice of being fired or transferred (which I saw a lot in the 7 months I was there) and most people never put in a two weeks, they just didn't come back in for work. if a job has been nice but I have to find work somewhere else, ofc I'll put in a two weeks. if it fucking sucks and it's a chain like this, I won't. this job stressed me out so much it caused health problems, stomach problems, and migraines about 3-5x a month so bad that I was sick and had vertigo. 

so a few days ago I just NCNS bc I started at a new job and like they do with everyone else I thought they'd shrug and say oh well I guess he quit. I blocked the stores phone number. a day later the store manager texted asking if I was okay, I didn't respond. later, a cop showed up at my door, my partner answered bc I have anxiety but I heard it all and the cop asked if a ""Mr. (mispronounced my last name"" lived there. my partner said no and the cop left and then we realized he mispronounced my name. so I believe they called for a welfare check. later, a coworker who I never gave my number to, texted asking if I was okay, and the store manager called him on his day off to ask him to get in touch with me. I said I was fine and had just quit bc it sucked. 

today, my coworker texted again saying the managers had asked him to tell me to call then because they want to speak with me. I haven't responded bc I don't want to put my coworker in a weirder position than he's already in, and I don't want to talk to the managers. I don't want to explain to them that the job just sucked and was toxic and destroyed my mental/physical health.

So not only is it a massive risk to the public when we service over 500 people in venue per day, we will also make our other staff sick if we come to work with the flu, causing even more call outs which defeats the purpose.

I work with one guy who really DGAF but he is a single man with no children or wife so I can see why he is able to embarrace this mentality.

I dunno, I just feel royally screwed as work is affecting my personal life and even if I get another job I know it will be the same corporate BS.

I didn't know what my hours would be until I got the contract. I saw the place was open from 9-6:30 but figured there would be 2 different shifts patterns so that you don't have to be there for 9 1/2 hours every day.

I'm not going to back out as I NEED this job (been unemployed for 3 months). Also, I do want to get into this career path and I have no experience so it's been a struggle. Just pissed off about these hours. They said I have to arrive 10 minutes early too, and it takes me 20 minutes to get home, so feels more like 8:50-6:50. I don't want to finally get home at almost 7pm every single day!

Part of why I wanted this job is I have always worked hospitality so I wanted a 9-5 Mon-Fri job to have more of a life. Now getting home at nearly 7pm every day feels like I'll still have no life. Especially when winter comes and 7pm feels like 10pm.

Just frustrated as fuck.

Yesterday morning at around 0530, my ""lead"" came to me to inform me of these discrepancies. Rather than offer solutions, he proceeds to state that I need to get my shit together and if I continue to make mistakes there will be corrective action. Whatever that means in his mind.

I laughed in his face and said to take me off the team if it's not working out. He said we'll be having a meeting later with ops (never happened). I said great. Nothing else came of it. No meeting, no corrective action, just a ""lead"" with an overinflated ego. The disrespect is next level.

45,2024-07-13,Enough is enough.,u/Youcouldbeoneofmine,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e28puu/enough_is_enough/,antiwork,"I am one of the two people in my business in a high stress, high pressure job where I am expected to work days, nights, weekends, holidays and answer the phone when I am on vacation.  Senior management is not qualified for their role and make decisions that routinely damage our ability to deliver a good service.  A few weeks back I pointed out (politely) that there were issues with a solution that was deployed at their behest.   This was done against the recommendation of the staff engineers and I proved it mathematically during a troubleshooting bridge.  The result was being snarled at in a group phone call by a VP, the VP demanded I be written up by my direct manager, THEN I was told to 'fix the problem'.  I can do a great many things but one thing I cannot do is overcome the laws of physics.  

It gets worse.  My team has been understaffed and management refuses to increase headcount.  The turnover rate is high once a new engineer gets a taste of the office clown show.  Finding replacements that can pass a technical interview is notch above 'all but impossible.'  So we end up hiring junior engineers to fill senior slots whom I have to spend considerable time training.  Yesterday I spent an hour explaining to an engineer on the staff for two years how to fix a fundamental problem that any competent senior engineer could resolve in minutes.   The result being I have to carry the staff even when they are on call for after hours support.

This is the way the business has operated in the 10.5 years I have worked there.  No one would dare complain to HR because they literally trip over themselves enabling senior management to retaliate.  I have watched a dozen excellent high performing engineers railroaded, fired or outright quit all for doing their jobs and pointing out problems originating from decisions made by senior management.  

After I was written up around 6 weeks ago it was the very last straw, I am done covering for these jerks and have been seeking a new job.  This is proving a challenge after applying for dozens of jobs across several states and being turned down or ignored.   My resume is posted on indeed and not more than three recruiters have contacted me over positions that pay half of what I make or are not a good fit for my skillset.  It's not easy finding a job as a 60 year old engineer, age discrimination is REAL.

The situation was looking bleak.  Then...two weeks ago a former colleague (Director level) contacted me, he left the company a year ago for the same reasons and took a VP position for a competitor.  He said he had an open engineer position and would be absolutely thrilled if I would consider working there.  Fast forward to this week, two interviews later he said I should expect an offer letter early next week.   He's a great guy, good personality, easy to work with and take the advice of his staff.  If the offer letter materializes (not counting my chickens before they hatch) then at last I can escape this living hell.   Even better, the office is 1 mile from my house versus 40 miles from my current job though I will be taking a $5k pay cut.  

The workload in my current job is overwhelming and there are many projects with tight deadlines that will need to be delivered in the next few weeks that require a senior engineer.  If the offer letter appears I plan on resigning on the spot, turning in my gear and walking out.  I have zero interest in being counter offered and even less sitting in an exit interview with an HR department that has enabled this behavior from senior management.  I am not exaggerating when I say there will be a panic and likely a meltdown when Senior Management finds out.   And I plan on blocking their numbers because I simply do NOT care what happens to them or the business.  Wish me luck and thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

The recruiter outlined the job and compensation (which was average) and asked if I was interested in moving forward. This would include a 3-day on-site interview.
Before accepting the interview offer, I visited the company’s website and found the full job description. Among the requirements, it stated: ""We work six days a week (Mon-Sat) in person in Mission Bay, SF.""

Further research indicates the CEO (and seemingly the entire executive team) is in their early twenties with no prior management experience. Apparently, their interview process, which involves three days on-site, if often a colossal waste of time. According to a blog post by their COO, ""We have interviewed 200 people, many with immaculate technical pedigrees and work experience at ‘the good companies,’ and none have passed the bar.”

I am not sure if this is all symptomatic of hustle culture, inexperienced management, or just a toxic workplace, but regardless, I am not going to subject myself to this bizarre process only to have a small chance at an unreasonably demanding job just because a company has a lot of money, cache, and famous investors.

2,2024-07-13,I quit yesterday! ,u/lolkoala67,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e2apaq/i_quit_yesterday/,antiwork,"Hi (boss)

After considering our conversation yesterday, I think at this time it makes sense for me to put in my two week notice and move on from (employer). You have been a good supervisor and I appreciate you advocating for me- but I can't help but feel discouraged about the outcome of things and also concerned about upper management among other issues. 

I get a sense that (bosses boss) has no real understanding of what my role is here at (job), nor do I feel like she has recognized my efforts here at this position or is willing to. I feel let down by the way certain things were handled, ranging from being ""trained"" at (other job location), which was kind of a mess, and now being advised to just leave my job here and switch over to another department as a solution. I have worked very hard here for the past 7 months and I have grown a lot in the role and I do it well- the numbers should speak for themselves. I work in a very fast paced, intense environment and I balance many responsibilities and have a very strong skill set that allows me to do so. For me to be in the same bracket as the front facing staff in (other job location) doesn't make any sense, and is totally unfair to be honest- we have massively different skills and abilities. I was a Financial Counselor for almost two years, and have that experience under my belt as well. It does not seem right that instead of acknowledging this, the solution is just for me to leave the position entirely and start over, more or less making the role I have cultivated here meaningless. There seems to be no consideration that working at (my location) is just a completely different animal than the other front facing locations, which see maybe 2 or 3 walk ins a day.  Just yesterday, I had 40 applications come in and 25 patient walk ins- this is not abnormal here. I have my hands full with these walk ins as it is, but I also have dozens of applications coming in each day that I need to work via Onbase. On top of that, I have been tasked with last-minute priority projects in the past, given little to no instruction, and left to my own devices. Not to mention the work queues, regular meetings, and other office responsibilities. It feels like the work keeps piling on because I am a competent employee who can handle it, but the recognition stays the same as does the compensation and placement in the ladder system. I seem to be in some gray area in regard to the ranking/ladder and it has penalized me. 

It feels like I was left behind in the dust- the ladder system was created many months ago and we were advised it should be finalized in April, but due to the way that it was handled with HR it has been stretched out to October- and now I am finding out that I am not even included in this new plan that has been presented to HR. Meanwhile, almost every other employee on the team has a level, as does any new hire. I do not feel that this process was handled very well, and I think important details are being overlooked and (employer) employees are losing out.  I have constantly shown growth and promise and an eagerness to learn new skills, but it does not seem to matter in the end as my growth in this role has been stymied by what feels like a flawed ladder system for the front facing team. In one day, I have the same amount of walk ins as an entire week's worth of walk ins in (other job locations), and my skillset is vastly different than that of the reps who work in these locations. It is disheartening that there is no acknowledgement of this or consideration, and that the only remedy is leaving my role. 

I am also very worried about the state of the customer service team- every day I put out fires with patients regarding the inability to reach reps over the phone. Patients come in enraged and furious that they cannot reach anyone, about long hold times, about being cut off and hung up on, about no one returning calls, etc. This has been ongoing for months. It is damaging (employer) reputation and it's becoming increasingly difficult to defend as a (employer) employee. The fact that we cannot retain employees or find anyone to fill these teams is concerning and it is creating a significant conflict with patients and making our jobs that much more difficult. This does not exactly inspire faith. 

The weekly mandatory early morning meetings are another thing that is a bit alarming to me. When I was hired back in January to work a Monday through Friday 8-4:30 schedule, I was surprised when I found out every other Tuesday I would need to come in outside of the agreed upon hours, but I did anyways with no questions. A couple weeks after that, I am told that I need to come in early every Wednesday morning as well. This is not a good business practice, and it's also not transparent in the hiring process and feels dishonest. It is not okay to hire someone for a specific schedule and then modify it as soon as they are hired. 

It feels like nobody really understands what I do here. Four months ago I was supposed to train my backup, but that has not happened nor has it progressed in any way. The person chosen as a backup does not have the financial counseling skills to perform this job (to no fault of theirs), and any time I have voiced this it feels like it's put on the back burner. What is the point of a backup if they cannot perform the job duties of the position/aren't in a position to learn them? I have tried to be patient with this as well, but it is frustrating when my backup is just a placeholder that leaves me the work that I missed when I was out. 

For these reasons I have decided to put in my notice. I am a hard worker, and I have always advocated for patients and defended (employer) and done my best to grow and thrive here- but I feel like my efforts have not been noticed or rewarded fairly and it seems like they won't be. I have been patient with the ladder process and with other concerns, but in the end feel neglected and overlooked. I have no incentive to continue to work hard because it is not recognized and I have been placed in some gray area with no opportunity for growth. And when I ask for the recognition and consideration I deserve for the position I was hired for, I am simply told to join a different team and begin anew at bottom of the totem pole. This is not an easy role- it is extremely busy, and having difficult conversations about medical debts in person is very challenging. There is probably no other position in (employer) quite like it, and it is disappointing that it does not get the attention it deserves. I hope one day it will."

Recently, I was hired as an administrator at a company in the architecture and construction industry. Despite my extensive experience, the job turned out to be a nightmare due to the complete lack of training and almost no supervision.

From day one, I was thrown into the deep end without any proper guidance. No one took the time to explain the processes or expectations. When I sought help, my inquiries were often ignored or brushed off. It felt like I was set up to fail from the start.

It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening to be treated this way, especially when I know I have the skills and experience to do the job well. I was committed to making it work, but the lack of support made it impossible. Eventually, they fired me, and I can't help but feel it was because of my age and learning disability.

I'm sharing this not just to vent, but to highlight the importance of proper training and support in the workplace. No one should be left to fend for themselves in a new job, regardless of their age or abilities. It's a basic expectation that companies should meet if they truly care about their employees."

They will have a paper schedule printed and in the break room for everyone to look at it. I’ll check it, take a photo, leave. We just got an app that also shows our schedule except it doesn’t correlate to the paper one. 
Yesterday I had the paper schedule say one thing and the app said another thing. I clarified with the supervisor what the time was and she told me I leave at 6:30. Later that day, she mentioned in passing that me and several others are leaving at 5. I remind her that earlier she said it was 6:30. The manager overheads this and says neither of those are necessary since we’ll be finished in 10 minutes and I can leave then. This ends up being untrue because just then another worker finishes up with an apparel rack and it has to go out to the floor. I do that along with a few others, and by then it was 6:30 anyways. Today the paper one said I work today but my app showed me as not working at all. I let them know and I guess they updated it since now it shows me working today. The problem? The app shows I get off at 6pm but the paper schedule and the text they sent last night says I leave at 4:30. And one time I made the mistake of going with the “official schedule” in the break room and clocked out at 4pm. As I was about to leave, they stopped me and told me that it had changed since I was told to come in 15 minutes later and that pushed back the shift to 4:15 and when I looked at the app, the new time was 4:15. So I had to clock back in and go back to work for another 15 minutes. I’m so fucking done with this place not ever knowing what the hell is going on. "
16,2024-07-13,Fuck capitalism,u/NorthernVale,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e2e48t/fuck_capitalism/,antiwork,"I remember learning about the different economic ideologies in school. Thankfully I had a teacher who didn't try to sugarcoat them one way or the other. At an early age I realized unchecked capitalism would mean I would never be more than a number. A company would only ever view me as an asset no different than a grill frying those paddies for your McDouble.

I also realized that being born into poverty when the system's already been in place this long, the most I could realistically hope for would to be seen as a valuable asset. It's sort of like playing poker with $100, but another guy is bringing a few grand to the table. Sure, you can get a good hand. But your luck won't hold long enough to even the odds. Even if they have shit luck, they can afford to lose several hands on pure bluffs just to force you into folding. Accept at this point, I'm trying to hop into the world poker championship with $20 to my name.

My only hope was that we had a government. Social contract theory should dictate that goverment we elect should be there to protect us from shit like greedy corporations.

And now we have this Project 2025 bullshit? I'm doing 62 hours this week, just so I can afford rent. Project 2025 is coming after my overtime. It's going after public education, so no chance in younger kids learning how they're well and truly getting fucked. Sweeping bans on abortions now. Wasn't the entire argument to get rid of Roe vs Wade that the federal government shouldn't have a say?

We have states making dress codes law. States making it so if someone calls you racist you can sue them. The supreme court is saying it's okay for a football coach at a state funded public school to force kids to pray.

Republicans are threatening violent revolutions, and in the same breath call the left radicals.

And the general populace... is just so fucking stupid. I'm sorry. I can't keep not saying it. At this point so many conservatives are just acting like god damned idiots.

""I like Trump because they can't buy him!"" Yeah no shit, he's the one doing the buying. It's not that they can't buy him, they don't need to buy him.

Fuck the democrats too. When republicans are in control, Americans get fucked. When democrats have the power, oop guess we get another government shut down until the babies on the right get their way anyways. Grow some fucking balls.

And at this point. Fuck gen x. I'm so sick of seeing videos like ""oh you don't want a gen x president, we'll go scorched earth"". Bitch please. You've had 25-40 years to make a difference. If your generation is so bad ass, how in the fuck have we let things get to this point? Do fucking better.

I'm giving up on this country. I'm done trying to convince people that it's not a good idea to elect a convicted con artist as your state representative. I'm done trying to convince people that gutting OSHA does NOT help the working class. I'm done trying to explain to people that the Trump administration raised their taxes. This is simple fucking shit confirmed in a couple minutes on google.

At this point, if you vote republican you're voting against the working class. You're voting against women. You're voting against children. You're voting against god damned America.

We're letting them take our country back to the shit our country was born to go against."

I have 10 years of experience in service, so I told my boss I know what I'm doing. It turns out working in a restaurant is a bit different than working in a bar, so I had to learn a bit. The boss was watching me like a hawk and micromanaging the order in which I set chopsticks on the tables and where I put down my tray before I go to grab food that has to go out. Long story short, she saw me work three times over a few weeks for like five minutes on end and apparently noticed mistakes, so she decided I'm not ready and doesn't give me the hours I need to pay my rent. So I tell her that I need to work more, to pay rent and buy food and to obviously get more experience. Two months go by and she keeps telling me that I somehow need to ""prove myself"" to get more hours and a fixed work shift. All I get is unpaid on-call shifts where you are called as the third or fourth server once the Bar is full and the main shift needs help. Which more often than not just doesn't happen, so I ended up sitting at home on call for hours on end, without being needed. I keep telling her that to ""prove myself"" I would need more fixed hours and that I need to be able to rely on my hours to survive. She asks my colleagues about how working with me feels like, they all give me compliments.

Now in my last month there, I had a total of 9 hours after 3 weeks. She writes me a pissy WhatsApp, telling me how I need to write down my hours right after work or she won't pay them at the end of the month. I'm like ""Bitch, these ARE my hours. I told you like ten times you are not giving me enough work.""

On my last day there, word got out that I was planning to quit and she got wind of it. She suddenly storms into the restaurant asking me ""I heard you want to quit?"". I'm like ""Yeah, I..."", she cuts me off and says ""Fine, you can go right now."". I told her I still have work to do and I have four shifts left in the month and this cunt actually answers me ""I know, but you can leave right now. You don't want to work, so you don't have to.""

I just laughed in her face and called her a two faced liar for trying to gaslight me like that. I told her so many times that I want to work more and she turns it around on me, lmao. I would love to write an anonymous google review warning others that think about working there. Since I live in a student city, staff rotation is crazy, but people also check out a business before they start working there. I know for a fact she would be fuming and respond to the review, so it could really make her dig herself into a hole, responding to someone saying it's a common occurence there that staff is registered for 40 hour weeks but only works 5 and sits at home for 35 hours without seeing a single cent of pay. But I know she would know exactly who wrote that review and she would use the fact that our city is small to bad mouth me to everybody in the restaurant business here.

I've been working in a bookbinders shop for the last two weeks now, which also pays minimum wage (without the tips of course), but it's so much more relaxed. I don't have to crawl into everybodies asshole for an extra dollar, I can chat with my colleagues and listen to audiobooks for hours on end while working 8 different stations. It's perfect, monotonous enough to do something along my work, but varied enough to keep my ADHD brain interested on the task at hand."

I have been asking for more shifts and FT over and over (email, in person, over text). They always have an excuse. Twice I have shown up and they tell me I will be training someone.

The FT secretaries do the least, cannot even order supplies (they ignored my training, rolled their eyes the whole time). I just saw they hired two more per diem secretaries, and I know one of the FT is leaving to go back to school. They have me scheduled to train these new hires. 

1. I know I need another job. I also need a decent rec from this job

2. I do not want to train a replacement for the job I want, but I don't want to get in trouble for NOT training them.

It's technically termed as a ""start-up"" though it's at least 10 years old as a company, and it's registered in Texas so even though my partner works in Washington State they get no benefits whatsoever. No sick leave, no PTO, no insurance, nothing. 

The owners of the company are this man and his wife and they bring home over 1 million a year together. My partner is on a shit wage that's just high enough to not qualify for any kind of state welfare, but low enough that managing on a salary like that is extremely hard. Especially because they live in Seattle and that place is pricey as hell.

My partner moved for this company. The company is run by a family friend so they trusted the job offer and literally moved abroad for the job. It involved a lot of travel and the work day is officially 9am to 6 or 7pm (though actual work hours vary). 

Their contract says they are a field agent who helps in training customers to use their products. But they've been made to do excel sheet work and because they're not doing 8 hours or more of work everyday they got yelled at and are now being forced to work even in sales. 

However the 8 hours shouldn't be mandatory in my opinion because the travel often takes away after work time and the like and there's travel almost every week which involves overnight stays and the drive to the locations. That's technically being on the clock for more than 8 hours a day at least 2-3 days every other week. 

In my opinion none of this should be legal, especially doing work outside the contract. I also think it's shady as hell that you can just claim your company is registered in Texas so you don't need to give your employees any benefits. 

To top it all off, the bosses arbitrarily get angry at my partner and yell at them. They accuse them of not doing work that's already submitted (without checking), text them rude messages after hours and in their personal time, and blame them for not prioritising work that's not even in their contract but has been dumped on them. 

This job is driving my partner insane and making them suicidal. We are in a long distance so I cannot be there to physically support them but I am begging them to quit and just come home and we can figure it out from there. 

That said, I don't want the bosses to go without consequences. Is there any group or anyone we can approach for help to maybe sue the company or demand better workers rights? 
At least expose them for the pieces of shit they are? Reporting to HR won't do anything because the man on top is also awful and controls their jobs. But I don't like feeling this powerless against such awful people. They deserve consequences.

The first two shifts were “open shifts” that a team lead told me I didn’t have to come in for (apparently I did) and the 3rd one was a shift I was asked “can you cover it?” *after it was already assigned to me in the app* and they never corrected it when I said I couldn’t. 

Now I have been given a new shift next Tuesday (no notification or asking if I can work that, which I can’t) and am going to confront someone about it when I get there.

I’ve already checked and I seem to be screwed here from a legal perspective, but I just wanted to get people’s opinions.

I put in my resignation a few days after that post. My last day was yesterday, only so I could use my accrued sick time and get holidays. I worked 2-3 days a week for the last few weeks. 

I left on okay terms, with the manager telling me that my work quality was stellar but that my attitude sucked. They wanted to leave me with two bits of advice: “honesty is kindness” and I need to “get comfortable being uncomfortable.” The former in reference to me being on my phone (this was an office job, not customer service or interacting with anyone; I listened to podcasts and audiobooks to stay sane, so pausing my podcast and putting on different ones is apparently lying because the manager thinks I was actually texting—jokes on them, I’m a professional, so I text while pooping) and the latter is in reference to me leaving the room while the manager was giving really harsh feedback to my coworker. I just got up and left; I will not watch someone be humiliated.

I do agree that my attitude sucks. I do not like being micromanaged to the point of every last minute of time being scrutinized, and I do not have a good poker face. Especially when my work is praised but how I do it is criticized.

My entire career has been pretty self-managed (academia and freelancing), so I’m a bit too feral to really be able to enjoy a 9-5 in an actual office (and I think humans shouldn’t even be working like that anyway). I acknowledge this and I am going to find a way to survive. I wanted stability but it turns out that I don’t actually want what it entails. No gods, no kings, no masters, I guess. 

Cheers to an unstable future in a late stage capitalist world. I’m happy with my choice to quit but also terrified of not know what the fuck comes next.

I feel like managers truly have a talent for appearing, taking things out of context, and snapping at their employees meanwhile not appreciating/acknowledging hard work. Then they wonder why their best employees now lack motivation. 

Mind you, this is still my first month at my job and my first introduction to my apparent “store manager” who I didn’t even know, and I didn’t even get a “hi” first.

I also feel that if I was older i would not be treated the same, and would be spoken to differently, and that is so frustrating because I am a hard worker and never just slack off just because."

I’m not the person to get in trouble or create problems and I never have been. I have BPD and it causes me to have suicidal thoughts which have been very strong.

The worst part is I know I deserved it. I was leaving early, sleeping late. The decision was attendance (not being on camera and being away from my computer, leaving the office early) and taking too long on a project when we had no data (I was expected to be a magician idk).

The brand was failing and I couldn’t say anything was getting better (to customers) because it wasn’t. I was always broke. Nobody ever trained me then wondered why I didn’t know things. I didn’t have a manager for a while so just did whatever after I finished the work (I don’t need 8 hours). When I did have a manager she micromanaged me with 4+ calls a day. She was never trained herself so I’d walk her through how I did everything. We lined up who does what and I had 18 more tasks since she didn’t know anything. Then she took credit for my work. I had reported a higher up for disrespecting me and nothing was ever done. I was overworked, and basically told “sorry this isn’t your job but we have a small team”. I was the first point of contact so everyone got to do whatever they wanted while I got the angry emails.

*I hated the job.* I had been telling them I was so unhappy since December. Asking for a new role.

I can’t stop beating myself up. I know there’s so many people on this earth but I feel like the only person this has happened to and I’m so dumb. I had so many dreams in college to be successful  just to be here scrambling to find a job since I still have bills and rent."

I’ve posted on here and in other subreddits about my clusterfuck of a job, and one of the things that drives me most crazy is that we are expected to find coverage for our shifts if we ever need to call out (not including time off scheduled in advance). So far I’ve only called out twice, and it hasn’t been a big deal, but I asked for a cover tomorrow and everyone said no. 

But frankly, fuck that! I mean come on, I’m expected to stay later than my shift is scheduled for and paid barely over my state’s min wage - the least my bosses can do is get a damn shift covered themselves. I’m afraid that simply stating that I’m calling out will get me reprimanded or even fired, but honestly, I could survive in the short-term without it.

I guess I feel kind of bad because I’m not even calling out for “serious” reasons but like shit, it’s one fucking day, and this job isn’t curing cancer or anything, so who cares??

When a manger finally arrived and helped the customer when he was walking away told us to ""Come outside and I'll fuck you up"" and kept circling back saying it. When I told a manager about it he completely ignored it and asked why I wasn't in my dept fixing stuff up (I was covering my coworkers dept while he used the bathroom). I asked the manager if we can get back to the point that we were just threatened and then we can get back to that.

He then told me that I am only a witness and that it only happened to my coworker and told me if u don't go and fix up my dept right now that It would basically be insubordination. So I walked away and told a higher up that I would be leaving early and told my immediate manager that I was leaving and told her the story and when I was clocking out the same manager that told me that I have to fix up my dept came around the corner and started arguing asking what was going on and that he doesn't understand so I said I'm not going to argue and that I was done and clocked out. 

I waited around the store before leaving just in case the customer was still around outside and told my mom what happened on the phone but as I was on the phone the same customer was staring me down so I went to the backroom and waited 30mins before walking home.

About 3 days later I was written up for lack of respect towards the individual (by the manager who argued with me and my immediate manager) towards the rude manager  so I recorded the write up discussion and opened a case about it with higher ups and 2 days later I explained my side of the story and they said that now it was due to me swearing to the manager (I didn't) so I argued that I did no such thing and that this wasn't said during my original write up and that I have proof of it cause of my recording.

Now they are trying to argue the legality of me recording without their approval however my state is a 1 party consent state (the asset protection manager said it was a 2 party) and that they have to check with the company to see if me recording was allowed and have since taken away the writeup however said that it will be put back up and I will be reprimanded for such.

1116,2024-07-14,Fired based on another employees word and an “NDA violation”… I was a restaurant server.,u/Hotdogwater88888,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e2vwur/fired_based_on_another_employees_word_and_an_nda/,antiwork,"Firstly I just have to point out how weird it is that they force every employee to sign an NDA just to work at their stupid restaurant. It’s not even a corporation, it’s just an extremely petty and insecure husband and wife. 

On Wednesday when I came in, first thing that happened was the manager telling me not to come in early. For context, I live in Texas where we were just hit by a hurricane. I was without electricity for 4 days, it’s 100°+ outside, and I lost all of my food. I came in 9 mins early to escape the heat after showering and getting ready at a local gym. It got on my nerves to say the least. 

I continued setting up for the day, until the owner asked to speak with me in another room. She immediately started the conversation with hostility, asking why I was talking shit about the restaurant online. I was confused because I didn’t know WTF she was talking about, and then she started quoting parts of my comment and said that it “makes them look bad”. I never added anyone from that job on Facebook either. In the comment, I was thanking someone for sending me a gift card to get some food. I mentioned that I worked down the street from them and that I just didn’t want to rack up a tab at my job because I’m poor and can’t afford the food at the moment. The owner immediately said that if she sees it again, that I “won’t be working there anymore”.. and “yeah the foods expensive, that’s how your bills are paid!” (Spoiler alert my bills are in fact not paid) and “if you have a PROBLEM, you have my number” like a 12 year old. she was extremely flippant and not interested in hearing anything I had to say. I tried explaining that the comment wasn’t about the restaurant, just about my financial troubles, and wasn’t intended to be negative. But she didn’t care and insisted that I was making them look bad and said that I “violated the nda by writing disparaging comments online.” This little “meeting” made me extremely upset. She was so fucking rude, and went on a power trip. I’m not the type of person that lets that go. 

In the server station, I vented about it and said that I thought she was really bitchy about it, and that I don’t like that she claimed that my bills are paid especially when the comment she’s complaining about literally says they are not paid. Well… one of those assholes immediately ran to the owners and told them that I “called her a bitch” and said “she needs to shut the fuck up” which I never said. But tbh even if I did it’s none of their goddamn business if I didn’t say it in front of them. I was just being honest. She WAS being a bitch about it, and their reaction to another employees hearsay means she KNOWS it too. Her husband immediately came up and fired me, while the tattle tale hid in the office. Did not review cameras when I employed them to (bc if he did he would’ve seen that the snitch was agreeing with everything I said. The snitch even has the owner BLOCKED on Facebook because she herself has been written up for her bf posts). He even went so far as to immediately trespass me as if I was a threat or something. The termination paper (which I refused to sign) also threatens me with a lawsuit if I “speak negatively of the restaurant or its staff”. That’s where the insecure part comes in, they can’t handle any sort of criticism. They also reply to every bad review online and argue with the reviewer. So cringey. 

So anyways I just wanted to vent about it. I’m honestly not sure how other people tolerate working for people like that? I guess if you’re bffs with your managers, it’s fine. But I don’t play the ass-kissing restaurant politics game. I thought serving would be a decent thing for awhile, but I’m thinking of leaving the industry for good because I cannot see eye to eye with restaurant management and their arrogant power trips. "

14,2024-07-14,Visa sponsorship hell,u/LegalGarden8362,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e2zew3/visa_sponsorship_hell/,antiwork,"Shared this one on Devrant as well. Be careful out there, not all companies are as nice as they seem.  
  
A few months ago, I started a tech job in London and immigrated here for that job. I was glad this company wanted to sponsor a visa, as that was a requirement for me to live here.

Unfortunately, after only a few months in, I learned that the company I joined wasn't quite as nice as I thought it would be. Bullying seemed to be part of the culture. On occasion, I saw coworkers crying. One of my close coworkers was dangerously close to burnout and then ""left with mutual agreement"". The environment felt like a high school cafeteria. People were drinking heavily early in the afternoon and people were leaving almost at the speed of a revolving door.

I recognized very early on that this was not a healthy environment for me, but as I just signed a rental agreement for a year, and spent a large amount to move here, I was kind of trapped.

Very early on, I was told that the two people before me in the same role were let go right before their probation ended. That scared me off, for reaching out to management or HR. I didn't have the financial needs to lose my job, and due to visa restrictions, therefore would have to leave the country.

When my probation was about to end, and I learned that my performance was good, I decided to provide feedback to my manager. I only mentioned a few things, but still enough. The manager seemed receptive, but it did not seem like he was actually willing to approach the problem itself.

Sometime later, I spoke to HR, explaining some of the issues, and explained my intent to resign. The rep pretended to care, but it did not seem sincere. At the same time, I reached an agreement with my landlord, so I believed I had enough money to safely move out of the country.

A few days after I resigned, the HR rep told me that I owed the company a large amount of money. A part of it was in the contract, which I accounted for. Another part, she was claiming, but was not properly defined in the contract. It said something, but it was confusing. I got a checked later with a legal advisor, and from what I understood, the company would never be able to make me pay that extra amount. This simply because of the contract being so vague.

I told the rep multiple times in the initial meeting about the flaws in the contract, but she ignored everything I said. I then made a counteroffer trying to get her to back off. She then put that in writing, but manipulated my words and kept out all the arguments I made about contract flaws, and my departure being the company's fault.

I didn't receive a reply to my counteroffer for days. It was stressing me out as this could mean I would run out of money soon. Only a few days passed before I got a medical emergency at work just because of the stress all of this caused me.

I saw a doctor and immediately got 2 weeks of sick leave. When I contacted the company again, I was able to terminate my contract, without returning to the office. However, they still didn't want to waive the extra amount of money.

The HR rep pointed out in written communication to my lawyer, something in the trend of ""if something wasn't clear in the contract, he should've just asked for details"". In that same correspondence, it also stated that they were offering 'as a favor to me' to reduce the extra amount to only a third of it.

Since I never actually wanted to go to court anyway, I decided to settle with that. Now I'm packing to move out of the country, without a job and soon to be completely broke. If I would've stayed where I were and never moved to London, and never worked a day for the past 7 months, I would've had more money on my savings account than I have at this point in time.

I hope I at least learned something from this. I don't think I will move somewhere with a company-sponsored visa again anywhere soon...

For anyone else looking for a job and considering relocation, proceed with caution. Thoroughly read Glassdoor, especially 1-star reviews. If the company has 20+ positions open, it would never hurt to ask them why that is the case. Don't make the same mistake I made..."

It doesn't matter if you work through lunch everyday, show up early & stay late, or produce the highest quality results. Your reward is just resentment from your coworkers and higher expectations from your boss. 

Managers always play favorites, and they will prefer the loudmouth brown-noser who is constantly in their office chatting with them (even if they barely accomplish the minimum amount of work). And this has been the case in EVERY single workplace. An average amount of work is acceptable, so long as the employee is 

Coworkers absolutely HATE you when you ""try too hard"". I am not the type of person who can sit around at work all day having personal conversations and accomplishing nothing. It is extremely boring, and I even enjoy working. It helps the day goes faster and gives me some purpose. But I have been accused of ""trying too hard"" from lateral colleagues. They get very nasty if they think you're making them ""look bad"". 

At my first job ever, I remember working so hard to make a good impression. I am a young blonde woman and typically get instantly written off as dumb and lazy or incompetent the moment I arrive at a job, so I feel like I have to prove that I'm capable and not a slacker. However, this backfired instantly. I received ""employee of the month"" after only being there for two months (some coworkers had never received the award, despite being there for years). And I began experiencing workplace mobbing. My coworkers absolutely hated my guts. If I walked into work 2 minutes late, they would run to the manager to report me (even if their friends sauntered in 20 minutes late on a daily basis). They would assign me the worst tasks, try to ridicule or humiliate me publicly, and try to pain the narrative that I was actually a lazy and terrible person. 

I actually enjoy working, and I put my all into every job. But I'm always hated and practically bullied out of every workplace. In every environment, it's always the exroverted, loudmouth bullies who prosper. No one cares about how ""hard working"" you are.  The issue is that people instantly view me as a slacker or a bimbo based on my physical appearance, and I'm almost punished for trying to prove them wrong or trying to ""outshine"" them. So I feel like I'm trapped in a lose-lose situation. "

The issue is they grow dull quickly and won't open the can all the way so we have to use like a metal spatula or a knife, some people use their hands, to pry open the can. Someone already cut themselves because of this. We've complained to management and it hasn't  made a difference. But what has really ticked me off was that a couple nights ago a couple of us were taking turns using the shitty opener but it just wouldn't open the can all the way. So a coworker grabbed a knife and started to pry it open but the recoil caused her to slice her finger on the can and a chunk of her finger is now missing. There was so much blood. We called 911 and she was still profusely bleeding when the paramedics came. What added to it was the first aid kit was EMPTY. I ran to the dollar store cause they didn't even have band-aids. I was so angry because this could have been avoided. I texted management about the issue again and sent them pictures of industrial can openers that can be mounted on a table.

I worked at Taco Bell Franchise and I am very aware of the fact that , to combat bad turnover rates for the upper management, whenever someone quit, they would still be active in the system for a very long while.

I gave my notice and my last day was July 2nd. I was issued a bonus that covers the pay period 06/26/2024 - 07/09/2024.

I am very aware that this is one week after my last date, BUT, it is on my Paycor, which gives me a paystub and the check was already issued and everyone that works there already has it, but my ex-manager did not leave it at the store.

How should I go about this? I am almost 100% sure that I am still not terminated on the system, so I would like to have proof that I am not eligible for this bonus (that is already issued and mailed and everyone has it and they kept mine), and I would love to see the proof that my termination was done on the 2nd of July, since that was the last day I gave on my notice.

Should I contact the Department of Labor directly? Should I contact the company's HR and tell them to mail me the bonus to my residence and ask for proof of employment termination?

Thank you guys in advance!



EDIT: I am still an ACTIVE Employee. I just went through my Paycor app/website and it states that I am ACTIVE. So that way I can confirm for a fact that they never terminated me and therefore I should be eligible for the bonus, right?

I will try to contact DOL tomorrow through the phone, but I can't seem to find the correct number. "

They offered training, so I decided to try it. Went to their job fair two towns over, had a good experience aside from the roads. Fix your roads please😭 I lost 3 psi in my tires..

They had some issues with the hiring website, but eventually I got cleared. I spent money for a background check, I spent money for drug testing, scrubs, etc. And then I get to the job site.

I was supposed to meet 3 people that day. I met only one person and they didn't even know I was hired in. I named off all the names who assured me I was in and she didn't know any of them.

They were supposed to show me how to get to the training website or let me shadow. But, I had to find all of that myself through reddit from people who also had issues finding the training area. Additionally, I couldn't get into my account to complete financial documents and if I didn't get it done that day, I would be terminated. I should have gotten my schedule, but I didn't meet the person who was supposed to give that to me.

It was all me trying to get all these people to coordinate and give me information. Finally, the first person I met looked into it and found both places were put on the job list mistakenly.  They had no openings nor hours. But they were going to put me somewhere 30-40 minutes away. Lol, no thanks. 2 months wasted.

I wish there was a chance I could get my money back from this process, but I know I have no case. Why the hell do companies do this? I already feel terrible because I can't get a job in my area, and now these people can'r coordinate and mislead me. I feel hopeless after this process, damn."

i work almost 40 hours a week/12 hr shifts at a warehouse earning a mediocre wage. even the hardworking immigrants in my personal life think this is overkill. when my coworkers complain to me about the way this job is they say we are very underpaid and they're also the same coworkers who are ready to drop their shit and leave if one of our superiors wants to start a problem. 

i stay here because i am disabled and mentally ill and the management is sympathetic towards this which is the one thing im grateful for. so if my performance is lacking and i need to leave early even if i have no sick time left i wont be given an issue, but these same people are the same people who play favorites and  theres a supervisor who is a total fucking sexist weirdo and everyone sees that she plays favorites with the cute and handsome guys here. not gonna lie i get left alone even when my numbers are mediocre as hell and im taking breaks when im not supposed to and i think thats partly due to some members of management thinking im cute and pretty. im clearly one of the other supervisor's favorites and he tried to talk shit to me about a coworker who can't focus on his work and made an inappropriate comment about him having a neurodevelopmental disability. 

aside from the way they speak about others and TO them, the management just fucking sucks at their job. they make the trainers do so much for them. they complain about the workload and thats why they need ""their help"" but like if you can't handle the workload then dont be a fucking supervisor? when YOU slack off its fine but when the people actually doing the productive work slack off its not okay and we're all lazy? 

i also have a lot of toxic coworkers. there is so much drama that i cant even begin to cover but theres a lot of two-faced, manipulative people here and there are also creeps. i was creeped on by an actual predator (everyone knows about this teenage girl he got pregnant) and theres these other old guys that chase me around.

i have my friends and talking to them helps me throughout the day but doing the same thing over and over again during a 12 hour shift will numb your fucking brain "

He made comments like “who has a 4th of July wedding?” And his favorite “I got a business to run here.” No you don’t you run a department in a store run by a corporation you bootlicking company kiss ass. 

I ended up getting the dates off as it was out of town thanks to another department needing me those days who overrule him. Plus I had my cousin send me all the bills for myself and the hotel. I was also part of the wedding as a grooms man on the state side. Boy how fast opinions change then. 

Fast forward to this weekend my brother is getting married. My girlfriend now works with me we took off yesterday and today 6 months in advance.

I asked her several times to correct the document but she wouldn't budge

Legal rules for firing she didn't follow -
1. Giving me at least a couple of days to prepare (I was given 4hrs) 
2. Even if I refuse a hearing (which means just that, not that you ""agree"" to be fired), you need to receive a document stating exact events they were dissatisfied with you and the reasons why you're being fired
3. Even if you refuse a hearing, they still owe you a day of ""thinking about it"" and not firing straight away 

Now, not only did this idiot not follow any of these rules, which I can take her to employment court over

Apparently, her sending the document I resigned is considered faking documents here and is a criminal offense, lawyer said don't even bother sending her a warning letter just go straight to the police

Environment is toxic as hell.

I've been applying for other jobs (100+ applications) for over a year now with not even a single interview.

I've fantasized about quitting without another job lined up just so I can not dread waking up every day but this market has me too scared to do that.

I'm really type A and a perfectionist and pride myself at being really good at my job. So it's really hard for me to mentally disengage from work. I think this job would be more tolerable if I cared less about how chaotic and messy the environment was.

I've been a great worker (for the sake of the people I'm feeding and the fellow workers I'm helping-) punctual, attentive, chipper, etc. I'll even stick my neck out for my coworkers if I've got the time and they're not dickish. They even gave me a raise!

But recently it's gone to absolute shit. I went from working 20+hrs/week to less than 12. I've been pulling less than $300 a paycheck for almost two months now. I went from working 3-4 days a week to working two days a week if I'm LUCKY. The prevailing theory among my coworkers (who are all in the same boat- a cashier went from 6 days a week to 1) is that they're trying to choke us out so we'll quit. All the people they're strapping for hours have worked there for 6+ months. 

I drive into work this morning- they have HIRING SIGNS on the front lawn!! It just pisses me off to no end- I bust my ass for you at odd hours of the night, long, busy shifts, etc. only for you to choke me out and replace me with someone you can pay less because YOU decided five months later that maybe giving me a raise (that I didn't ask for) was too expensive?

So I recently graduated college in May and have been working at this entry-level job this summer. This job had horrible management and various HR issues already so I wasn't too keen on staying there anyway given how they treat staff.  I was finally offered a salaried position in my field by a new company so today I put in my one-week notice at my entry-level job (I understand two weeks is the norm but I really need this new position), I thanked my entry-level job for everything in my letter of resignation, acknowledged the short notice and mentioned I was willingly to do my best to ensure a smooth transition during my last days. 30 minutes later, my manager sent me an email, addressed to both me and my assistant manager stating ""I'm happy to hear about this opportunity for you. It's unfortunate you couldn't give us the courtesy of a two-week notice."" IN THAT SAME EMAIL, she writes to the assistant manager to ""go ahead and hire her replacement"" and ""extend the offer of employment"" to him, noting that she already had his paperwork ready to go. I found that to be extremely petty and unprofessional, why would you need to add that in a response email about my resignation? She purposefully wanted me to see it and react. So I simply responded back ""In light of your extended email, my resignation will be effective immediately. Thank you."" I have never dealt with such unprofessionalism from people 20 years older than me but anyway I'm happy to be leaving that enviornment. "

* Cost of Living is approximately 25% higher (I have 3 sources citing COL ranging from 20-29%)
* I meet all of the required qualifications and exceed their education requirement  (they require a bachelors and prefer a masters, while I have a Ph.D.)
* I am about as far away as geographically possible while staying on the same continent so it will be a hell of a move.

I need medicine to keep from having insomnia because I’m so paranoid at night and more so afraid of having these nightmares. My pharmacy was not answering the phone or getting in contact with me about my medication, which had just been upped because it stopped working.

So for about 30 hours in actuality (I told her 24), I did not even shut my eyes to sleep. The longer I was awake, the more paranoid I got. So I called in to work.

The next day, I’m opening, and she asks if I have a doctor’s note. I asked her if a note from my psychiatrist would be valid because it’s a mental health related absence. She says,”Well I don’t know if we can use that as an excuse, really. I mean sometimes you have to just push through it and come in.”

I told her I hadn’t slept in 24 hours and that’s why I called in, and she just reiterates. “Well I have sleep problems too, sometimes it’s not an excuse.”

She wrote me up for lack of a doctor’s note and failure to find cover for my shift. Because when I texted the group chat begging people, humiliating myself, to cover my shift, that wasn’t enough of an effort apparently.

I’m just wondering how this is legal? PTSD is recognized as a disability, and sometimes (most of the time) it does inhibit my life to the point I am unable to do basic tasks, like… sleeping… for example. One of my managers knows I have ptsd and have nightmares caused by it."

So I've left an employer due to horrific work culture and safety issues and I've just recieved my latest paycheck, however this paycheck has a new deduction added on for a pension.

I have never had this deduction taken from any of my previous paychecks but I know in my contract there is a page about the pension, it says you will be automatically enrolled if it's applicable but that I would be sent the account details and my enrolment date before I'm enrolled, however I have not been sent these details and I have no access to the account nor was I aware I was going to be enrolled.

It says I have 30 days from my enrolment date to opt out and get a refund but I have no idea when my enrolment date was and I get paid monthly. Is there anything I can do to recuperate these deductions and will it still be possible if I'm past the 30 day mark? I feel this is in retaliation to me leaving and no longer taking calls outside of work hours. Is this even Legal?

I'm currently in therapy because I have ASPD. For that reason, I tried to find the most anti-stress job possible. I just want relaxing work. That is all.

My first attempt, delivering inventory to restaurants failed when they discovered I can cook and increasing responsibilities were laid upon me. Additionally, ASPD made having a boss incredibly difficult.

My second attempt has just failed.

I decided I missed cooking, and got a very simple line cook job at one of those restaurants where anyone can walk in off the street and cook.

The GM told me they don't promote people for two reasons: their performance doesn't merit it, or they specifically request no promotion.

A few weeks in, I made it clear I do not want a promotion.

The best cooks at these type of restaurants is the fast cook. I can be fast, but it is tiring. For that reason, I accepted a low pay and guaranteed I'd be worth that price.

I was. But I didn't overexert myself for insanely fast ticket times. Worked the value I was paid.

They want to reward fast cooks with training. When you are trained on an additional station, you get a raise. 

Many of the cooks are irresponsible. They cannot be trusted to do what they need to do without supervision.

But I can. For this reason, when it gets slow and they don't need a lot of cooks and the boss needs to do paperwork, I am one of the ones who stays. I am responsible for cooking at some of the stations missing people. We still get orders, especially online ones, during this period.

I am not officially trained. When I requested training, while casually mentioning I am starting to submit resumes, they slotted me for training.

I failed the first job interview. I told coworkers about my failure, and it's as if word spread to the boss, because my training got cancelled.

I then told the bosses boss, they better be careful because I have started to send out resumes.

Finally, they slotted me for training on the last day of a schedule almost three weeks out.

I landed a job interview for a position making 25-50% more money. Same type of cuisine, almost the same menu, but made from scratch.

A few days later, I emailed 3 of my four bosses up the chain demanding either immediate training or an immediate raise, as I am responsible for something but not getting paid for it.

The very next day, I had my interview and landed the new position. I took their minimum offer and asked that my pay be reviewed again later, to match my performance.

I am not the best cook, but this job relies more on knowledge than the last. I'm looking forward to it.

Upon accepting the offer, I immediately drove to my current job and put in a two week notice.

That was a few days ago.

Last night, after hearing that at the end of the night every night until I leave, ai will be responsible for the station which I'm not trained, I informed the boss I was leaving because I didn't get a 25 cent raise that comes with training on that station. He then asked me how much I'm getting at my new place, and he was flabbergasted to hear how much more it was. Shows the value he put in me.

He tried to get me out of work early, but the other cooks threw hissy fits.

He said he can't give me a raise. Only the biggest boss can. I told him he had plenty of time to train me, and the raise came with the training.

I emailed the big boss and my immediate boss and his boss just now demanding a 25 cent raise. I also told a little boss not in my direct chain of command that if my demands aren't met, I walk. And that the reasons aren't extortion, but to get what's fair to me. And asked her to mention this while vouching for me in the morning.

I've been more that fair. Two weeks notice, in this situation, is generous. We shall see very soon if I walk out.

Either way, it's very satisfying to move on to bigger and better things. Not quite the antiwork style, but I hope you guys appreciated it

HR has been reached out to and if you send in a complaint about your DM/RM you are being banned from speaking to HR in general.  I have been with this company for years and the fact they are doing this to us is truly detrimental to my life. I depend on this job. Many of my coworkers can no longer afford to live with basic necessities and are scrambling to find new jobs. If you are caught speaking about any of this online you are automatically fired. most employees  are afraid to say anything because of retaliation. Has anyone ever had something similar happen?? I feel so lost. how can they do this??? 

im sorry if this is the incorrect sub to post in. this is a alt account. i really just needed to vent and hear from others. thanks."

34,2024-07-15,Recruiters reaching out to people just to ghost them?,u/OfficePsycho,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e3vcbd/recruiters_reaching_out_to_people_just_to_ghost/,antiwork,"About a decade ago I got an interview with one of the biggest competitors to my then-employer. More accurately, I was scheduled for a phone interview. I called in, ecstatic at a chance to escape where I was currently working, only for the recruiter to never call in. I wrote her afterward, but she did not respond to my e-mail. Two days later I got a scheduling e-mail from the same recruiter, wanting to schedule another interview, with no mention of the one she skipped. I accepted, both because I was desperate to leave my job and because I wanted to see what she’d say about missing our first interview.

She didn’t mention the first interview at all. On top of that, while the second scheduling e-mail indicated it was for the first position I was to have interviewed for, the actual interview was for an admin position regarding finance; I worked in healthcare, directly with patients. She went on to do and say some things that left me feeling she had a serious drug problem, and was blitzed out of her mind as we had that second interview. Because of that, I always attributed her blowing off our first meeting as being due to whatever demons had hold of her.

I left my long-time job in November.  Exactly a week after I quit I got a job interview, and within two hours I had a job offer. The next day the recruiter called me up, asking if I had a very specific skill set that, if I had it, would surely have been on my resume. When I informed her I did not, she rescinded the job offer, and ended our conversation by asking me to send her way anyone I knew with the skill set the job needed.

Since then I’ve had one bait-and-switch of a job, and been unemployed since February. About two months after I became unemployed again the recruiter who offered and rescinded the job offer reached out to me again. She was interested in placing me with another position. Needing a job, I expressed my interest to her . . . and she promptly ghosted me.

Fine. I already knew she wasn’t to be trusted after the first experience. Whatever.

Several weeks after that I have a recruiter reach out to me on LinkedIn, wanting to connect and saying she wants to talk to me about an admin position in healthcare. I accept their connect request, write her back, and proceed to have her never talk to me again. No response to my messages, and she’s still posting away on LinkedIn, so it’s not like something happened to her.

A few weeks after that, I have another recruiter on LinkedIn reach out to me to connect and talk to me. Just like the last one, they go silent, despite having reached out to me about a job they wanted to place me in.

Two weeks ago, I have a recruiter reach out to me on LinkedIn. She’s pushing for me to interview ASAP, either that day or the next. I write her back and set up an appointment for the next day. She writes me, asking me for my phone number for the phone interview and a copy of my resume. I feel the latter is kind of weird, since my resume is open on LinkedIn, but I figure it’s the equivalent of having to upload your resume on a website, then having to type all of it in.

So the time comes for my interview comes . . .and goes. I waited 45 minutes, and got nothing. I’ve also received nothing in my e-mail about the missed meeting. I haven’t reached out because, frankly, after all the other times I’ve been ghosted by a recruiter my attempts to reach out afterward were ignored, so why do it again?

All the people in recent times have been on LinkedIn for extended periods, with vast numbers of connections and regular postings, so it’s not like they’re all scam profiles trying to harvest data for some reason. I just don’t understand the point of recruiters reaching out and then ghosting. I keep picturing it as though they have some sort of quota of outreaches they have to do to keep their job, with actual hiring being beside the point.

Everyone I’ve spoken with talks to me as though they’ve never heard of it before, and I have to ask if it’s really just me, or if others are experiencing this as well?

If I’m being paid at this time, I come in at this time not 10-15 minutes earlier.

So, I work for a private education company on a part time basis, 3 days a week. On 17th May, my manager asked me to second mark a set of exams by another teacher. I agreed, with the assumption that the papers were ready to be second marked that week.

The other teacher did not submit the exams in that month. They only submitted it on 8th July, the last week of the academic year. We had a bunch of trainings happening that week. I explained to my manager that I will not be able to mark these exams with such little time. She said I come in on my non-working days. I said I can't as I have my own side business that I run on those days. Essentially another job. 

So, I didn't check my emails. Today, I took my annual leave. My manager was calling me on my phone, but I didn't answer as I was getting on a plane with my partner for our holiday. Wasn't looking at my emails either obviously. 

I get a message from my neighbour, saying there is some lady standing on our door knocking constantly. We were not expecting any deliveries and all of our friends and family know we are abroad. So, I asked my neighbour to take a picture of the person.

To my shock, the person in the picture was my colleague. I was really confused because I am not friends with any of my colleagues that I would share my house address with them. So, I go into my emails to contact HR about this and find an email from my manager that as I am not responding to phone calls or emails, she sent a colleague over to my home to talk to me in person about this 'urgent task.' 

My manager is now literally stalking me in my own property. I have emailed HR about this. I would take legal action but we don't earn enough money to be able to pay legal fees.

I’d have no issue with leaving, other than my current contract requires a two month notice, and charges employees two months pay if they don’t provide it. For me this would be entirely prohibitive (talking a little less than 10k), if the new employer didn’t cover all or at least some of it.

I’m writing because I’m in a weird and uncomfortable situation at work. Basically we have a team of 3 including my self, and we had lots of major changes at work (layoffs, our manager being fired) and it took us a while to get adjusted. We had a technical manager we are reporting to and have been since early March. We also have a senior direct we report to that has the actual title of “Manager” and it says we report to him on paper. So basically we were spoken to recently because we all kept arriving late and leaving work early. I was told today by my technical manager that he received feedback that I was the only person cited for doing this, (with him knowing very well the ENTIRE team was doing this). He said he was spoken to by the director (my manager on paper) and when my name was brought up he didn’t bring up anyone else and simply said he would speak to the team as a whole. He then apologized for not “protecting me” and very outwardly explained that he wasn’t going to put another team member who was doing much worse than me on the spot. He PROTECTED HER and used me as a scapegoat. I am disappointed as I feel outted and don’t think it’s fair to take the fall for everyone. I don’t know what to do. I know HR is there for the company. This just isn’t right.. but I’m not sure of what to do. Thoughts? "
13,2024-07-15,The work-life balance and career enjoyment is going down day by day. Feeling really upset about all this.,u/QuestionsAsker99,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e40t6h/the_worklife_balance_and_career_enjoyment_is/,antiwork,"I thought that I do love my job and a career as a whole and been working for this company for a bit over 3 years. Great pay, good work-life balance as well as pretty generous and flexible PTO policy until the very recent events.

So the company was going through a bit of a rough patch, and many people were encouraged to work a bit extra and even do some work on the weekends, after hours, etc. Not much work was required at all, just a few clicks here and there to mitigate some thigns that were completely out of anybody's control. I didn't mind that at all. It lasted like this for several months.

So the rough times have ended, the company didn't up losing much money on it, no layoffs happened as a result and everything is back to normal, but the unpaid extra work and work on the weekends has become a new normal! The work that we used to do Mon-Fri is now partially expected to be done Sat-Sun so on Mon we do the Tuesday's work, etc. It is completely normal to now see a message from the boss on Monday morning of a sort:"" I sent you an e-mail on Sat at 11 PM, why didn't you respond?""... Even though it is a completely non-urgent bs that could be clearly done during the week with no issue.. and the company became much more reluctant to approving the well-deserved PTO.

I know many of you tell me to find another company where they treat their employees better, but this was an absolutely great firm not so long ago. What are the chances that other companies are better?"

I work at Raising Canes, the fast food restaurant, and so far it has been the weirdest environment.

different managers follow different rules. Im told different ways to clean things everyday and then told the way i was doing it is wrong. The next week ill see a manager do it the exact same way i WAS doing it.

I was trained on cooking toast for 5 minutes then sent into our busiest time. my manager acts awkward like IM the weird one for asking questions. she stares at me like i gave 3 heads and just goes “uhh..”

new people are hired every week it seems and someone is also fired every week. i have not seen a lot of my coworkers i liked return in a while. My favorite manager was just fired Too, and im worried my other manager is about to be fired too.

they have also mentioned cameras and microphones being around the building so they can “hear everything”. This is so stressful i cant stand it. I come home and cry every night. Im a closer. Im 17 years old and close every single weekend. I cant really see my friends. I was there 6-1 AM yesterday, 4PM-11PM the day before, 4PM-2AM (came in early, was scheduled 7PM-2 AM). I just work all night. Its every weekend almost. My hours and days are inconsistent too. I work tuesdays and thursdays randomly. I only have 15 hours next week. Then 22.5 after that. also why are they hiring a billion people???? Theres a new orientation with 6 people every two weeks. Were already overlabored nearly every single shift. I get sent home early all the time. my check this week is 159 (I get paid weekly). I feel like we shouldnt hire this much?

is being an adult really this bad??? Is it me or my job? I feel like its not normal to come home wondering if you’ll be fired next just bc you didnt charge for an extra sauce on accident. i like my coworkers but i hate hate hate my job. It would be so much easier if the work environment didnt feel so stressful and tense. i hate that they can “hear everything” we say all the time. I just wanna make some money to move out :/"

I got referred by my co-worker to his company, the company looked very interesting and I love what they are trying to achieve, they are very small startup of 10-20 people. So after couple of interviews I was offered a role. Little did I know I was shooting myself on the foot.

My co-worker sucked up to the CEO and got himself a big fat promotion to senior leadership from senior engineer, I still don’t know why the CEO gave him that title.

Once he got promoted, he started firing people with no remorse, giving an example of his toxicity 
He told an employe he doesn’t like to work on very important tasks on Friday and get it done by Monday. After the employee finished the work he zoom called and told him that he is getting fired and it is effective immediately. He did it in front of me, 

I immediately lost all the respect I had for him, he was drunk with power.

 I had couple of arguments with him by proposing couple of better solutions to a problem but he dismissed all my proposals saying it is not right for the company.

After this started all the toxicity 

Stage 1 : micro managing 

He slowly started micro managing me by asking updates ever hour and once he openly told “ I dont have confidence if you will be able to do it” . I told him that this is making me uncomfortable, he said “sorry that I am paranoid , i want you to succeed , So please bear with “ i was surprised af when i heard that, this is when I decided I made a wrong decision by coming 

Stage 2: excessive phone calls to personal mobile

He calls me 10 times a day for things that are not even important, he once called me to remind me that there is a meeting in 10 mins, the same meeting I have rsvpd that I would attend.

For every small mistakes that I make he calls me tells me that “this is bad, this is not working out” which spoils my mood to work entire day

Stage 3: comparing

He tells one of my co worker about what exactly to write as updates and where to post the update and whom to tag, he personally writes couple of messages and asks my coworker to go and post it so people would think he wrote it.

Then one a 1:1 meeting with him he told “ look
At your. Co worker he posts so many updates and is highly visible, you are not on his level”

My co worker told this to me “he writes and tells me to post these messages “

I had a pretty big argument today with him, and there is a call scheduled with him and the co founder” either I am getting fired or they are putting on PIP.

Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but he always makes comments if we’re checking our phones for even 30 seconds, switching songs in our playlist, or going to the bathroom (we don’t get 15 minutes breaks here). They’re very demanding here about our numbers for production and want a specific very high number per day. Even coworkers whose numbers are slightly less gets mocked in front of everyone by management. They set up “competition” where we compete to see who gets the highest numbers, and if you’re not first, management will laugh in your face about who got higher numbers than you, in front of the whole team. Lastly, we get paid minimum hourly wage. Wondering if it’s even all worth it to put up with this anymore"

New job, girl before me got fired for being defensive. They walked her out, never sent her her stuff or allowed her to gather it. I guess she left screaming so sounds like she was most likely the problem.

But… 

Week 1 down, only got 2 days of training and they themselves referred to it as “throwing me to the wolves”

Every little mistake is laughed at and respect is non existent. 

If I have any reaction that can be seen as defensive, even if I’m just saying “no this is what happened” when they assume something incorrectly, I have a “talk” with my sup about it like it’s a huge deal. 

I’m feeling stuck. I’m feeling like it’s obvious I’m not a good fit. I fear they are slightly pushing people out by being so particular and needing to have sit downs about every little thing.

This morning I was referred to as “miss (my name)” in a not pleasant tone of voice before having a “sit down” about me calling the paper work “nit picky”  when I indeed did not say that I simply said the paper work is particular and meant nothing by it other than an observation as a new and learning person and they made this big deal of it and called me defensive when I apologized if it came off wrong but I didn’t mean anything by it and that I know it’s particular for a reason.

Looking for a new job already just wanted to see if there’s any advice to fix this situation as I don’t love that I’d be leaving so soon after stating a new endeavor.

Thank you for any and all advice! "

One of my pain points was my pay, because of how inconsistent it was and some questionable withholding practices. Can someone help me clear up some of my concerns?

1. Payday: So in our employee handbook, it stated that payday for salaried employees was the 1st and 15th of the month with our commission being paid on the 10th. The reality was that paydays were actually the 5th and 20th instead. Is there any recourse on this?

2. Medical Insurance Withholding: When I signed up for my benefits, I was told verbally by our controller that the cost would be $187 per pay period. The reality was that I was being charged $309 3 times a month (taken from each check) because they were “catching up.” I had asked for the records before and was denied.

3. Final Check: My final check that was provided to me had an even larger amount of insurance pulled from it, $415, leaving my normal check being reduced from a typical $1875 take home to a whopping $256 because I was laid off on the 19th of the month.


If there are any red flags here, do you think I’d have any legal recourse I could pursue?"

Living in a J-1 house where the borderline insane landlord is abusing students’s rights. How do I stop her?

Today a student got kicked out of the house where I live for taking her friend’s towels out of the trash can when the landlord threw them out. 

There was a fire inspection today, and the landlord, we’ll call her Evelyn, freaked out because there were a few towels and shirts hang drying on the second floor balcony. Evelyn asked a student, we’ll call her Lizzie, if the items were hers and they weren’t so Lizzie said so. Evelyn preceded to grab all the items and take them to the trash. Lizzie said “wait those are my friends clothes, I can take them,” and Evelyn said that the items were now trash. 

Lizzie couldn’t stop her so she took the clothes out of the garbage cans afterwards and out them on her bed. Evelyn stopped Lizzie and took the clothes from her insisting they were trash. She yelled at her and Lizzie said please don’t scream at me. Evelyn yelled “this is my house and I can scream at whoever I want” and continued to scream at Lizzie for a while, before throwing out the clothes. Evelyn then told Lizzie to leave the house within two hours or she would throw out all of her possessions. She then filmed Lizzie crying while laughing at her.

 Liam, another j-1, then spoke to Evelyn on Lizzie’s behalf. He asked if Lizzie could apologize and Evelyn said she didn’t want to speak to Lizzie or see her and that she needed to leave. Lizzie had to go to work. I and many of the j-1s in the house work the same job. Our employer got Evelyn to allow Lizzie leave after her shift but he refused to do anything more, despite owning some of Evelyn’s other leases, which is understandable as Evelyn owns the house. The employee made a deal with Evelyn pre season to allow his employees to stay at the house but he won’t help us anymore.

Evelyn also removed/stole several hot plates and an air fryer which belonged to the students and threw them in the garbage due to fire code violations. The fire code is understandable, but she has stolen personal belongings and discarded them. Unfortunately, there were rules against much of this behavior in the lease contracts the students signed, but they have not been provided with a kitchen and have no way to make food for themselves.

This is the cumulation of a lot of bad experiences in this one house, and I don’t know what to do or if there is any hope to make this better. For context, I’m an American living on the NE coast for a summer job. I’m living in a house with a bunch of J-1 foreign student workers who are also here for a summer job. Fortunately I have local friends who have been able to help me out with these problems but the j-1s are getting increasingly screwed and I want to help them.

The house is old and repaired but not well furnished. Students are being punished for leaving trash around and being dirty but they have nowhere to hang out, and at the beginning of the season they hadn’t even all been provided with garbage cans.

This is not the first incident with Evelyn by far. She has been blacklisted from j-1 housing programs in the past, but she got back in. She has made our lives hell this summer and I’m looking for any advice.

She has a couple of Air BnBs on the first floor of the house (which is why the students don’t get a kitchen—it’s for the air bnbs) and I’m wondering if there is at least a way to tank her reviews on this platform. Any and all advice is appreciated."

92,2024-07-15,didnt even last three days driving delivery for a mom and pop pizza shop,u/Duthos13,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e4c4w8/didnt_even_last_three_days_driving_delivery_for_a/,antiwork,"i am on fixed income. its not a ton, but it is enough to pay my bills, keep me fed, and even fund a little bit of fun once in awhile. but it gets very boring staying at home, and i recently have been putting in concerted effort to get out of my house, make friends, and maybe even meet someone. and i had the bright idea to drive delivery for a local shop for several reasons. 1) im a professional driver. 2) good chance to meet new people. 3) new pizza hut opened in town *right next door* and i actually felt bad for a small business suddenly having to compete with a megacorp. 4) it just seemed like it might be fun. and tbh, it was. the deliveries anyway.

thing is, these guys had a real problem with the idea of paying someone who wasnt actively working. and, tbf, i really didnt mind helping out on the kitchen. slicing meat/cheese, or doing some dishes, it hardly arduous work. and working with someone who like to joke about made it pretty enjoyable (the mom). but anyway, they started going to greater and greater extremes to find things for me to do while waiting for more deliveries to come in. they hadnt had a driver for awhile, so their regulars werent calling for deliveries, but ads had been made and business was expected to pick up soon.

anyway, on day two buddy boy (the dad) made a point of telling me to push the dishrack back through the dishmachine rather than carrying it back around to the other side. so water didnt get on the floor. i've worked in kitchens, off and on, for years. water on the floor in the dishpit is just something that happens. i found this particular directive silly enough i simply found other ways to keep myself for the day and didnt wash any more dishes. though to do this i cleared off and cleaned numerous shelves that really didnt need it.

anyway, day three. about halfway through the day. waiting on deliveries, all meet/cheese needed had already been prepped, and i wanted to be helpful so i started doing some dishes. remembering the discussion from the day before i made a point of giving the rack a little shake before carrying it around so that if any water DID drip onto the floor it would be a drop or two. significantly less, i might add, than ended on the floor every time i washed my hands. which, being in a kitchen, i necessarily did very frequently. anyway, buddy boy sees me carrying the rack over to the loading side of the machine, and he *instantly* starts berating me, with his voice rising with every word. before he finishes his first sentence he is about two notches below yelling. and this is about the time my own nature kicked in. i do NOT respond well to being yelled at. dude is a throwback from a previous generation where treating employees like shit was acceptable, about 70 i would say. anyway, i respond to aggression with more aggression. i know i know, perhaps not the best way to handle things. but it is rarely an issue because people rarely get aggressive with me (perks to being 6'2"" and athletic). anyway, soon as i matched his tone and volume he shut up real quick, and i told him if he ever raises his voice to me again i will walk on the spot. he wandered off.

didnt really know, or care, how it would play from there. but figured since i was still having fun overall i'd wait to see how it played out. couple hours later, long after everything was calmed down, buddy boy was being friendly, and him and his wife both seemed pretty enthused about delivery picking up in short order, and i most likely wouldnt have any time at all to help in the kitchen. was a pretty friendly chat, plans for the future, basically no indication that our encounter would be an actual problem. frankly, i thought we had come to understanding over it; dont yell at me and you dont have any problem with me. anyway, shift ended, went home to the usual friendly flurries of 'good night, see ya tomorrow'.

of course, buddy called me up before my shift the next day to courageously fire me over the phone before i came in."

A couple of facts first. I work from home doing call center stuff. We have to change our work status to show what we are doing. I'm located in Canada.

My boss recently pulled me into a 1on1 meeting over teams and basically told me that I can't go to the bathroom anymore. What he told me exactly was that 'If I go over my 15 minutes given for both 'break' and 'personal time' (bathroom), I will be deducted time for each minute I am away. Thats 15 minutes for each for a total of 30 minutes, and they can be split up as needed. The thing is, I already gave them a doctors note saying that I have IBS which makes me go to the bathroom frequently. I feel that they're gearing up for constructive dismissal and at the very least this makes me extremely stressed out and that I'm being punished for having a condition that is beyond my control

I'm thinking about sending an email back to my manager to: 1) get everything in writing as he told me this verbally over teams and 2) Let them know I am not going to take their shit in hopes that they back down. 

I need to know if this is a good idea. I was also thinking of CCing HR in the email (I know they aren't friends) because I'm pretty sure what my manager is suggesting is a human right violation, but I could be wrong. I don't have much experience in this so any help would be appreciated. Thanks to anyone who responds ! !"

Why is it that every day he needs updates on how many orders from a different department comes to my inbox. And he needs updates every day. Also we have notifications that comes to our inbox based on the royalty of the customer. It’s imperative that as soon as we get this customer order we have to put their order in the system right away. Forget about the other customers and focus on them. 

I don’t like the fact that this certain co worker I work with constantly teams messages me about updates. How can I politely tell them to go away. I been at the company for 2 years now and I don’t understand why he even has this as his task. I kind of think he just wants to kiss the upper management tail all day to move up fast in the company. I can’t stand being micromanaged. 

Not only that we have a new supervisor and it seems like just because I am the only one that’s been at the company the longest I am constantly given more cases than the other team members on the team. I noticed the new co worker doesn’t even have as many cases as I and another member has. So it makes sense that he has a bunch of time to keep asking us for updates. 

Today I told them to check the posts and comments I make under the customer order on Salesforce. I basically told them I am no longer going to keep sending team updates. I make comments on Salesforce so if it’s something he needs updates on he can kindly search the customer number on SF and find the information. I suddenly got very annoyed with them yesterday. Constantly asking for updates.

I interviewed for a part time position last August but then decided I wanted full time. At my second interview, they liked me so much, they created a hybrid position for me. I was Supportive Services/Admin, and I loved the job. They fired my immediate boss after I was there about three weeks, leaving us with no property manager. We had a Director but she was spread pretty thin, so we didn’t see her very often. The admin part of my job was clearing up a huge backlog of recertifications that the former property manager left undone. I taught myself how to use the system, and myself and one of the clerks worked together and finished about 150 of them. The Director of the entire agency found out and gave us a nice bonus.

Because we had no manager, I often stepped up when necessary. For instance, if a tenant was upset by a rent increase or there was conflict between neighbors, I handled it. After only seven months on the job, I was promoted to assistant property manager, while keeping my Supportive Services role. At the same time, Broomhilda ( not her real name, of course) was hired as Property Manager. 

At first, I thought that she and I would work well together. But then she started making a lot of changes. She told me that I would move to another building, where I was told that I would be managing it. I was excited because a lot needed done there. I got along great with my staff, but then the emails started. One day I got 14 emails, not counting replies! She told me that everything I wrote had to go through her, even a simple notice to only put small trash bags in the chute. She would make a few changes and put her name on it. No biggie, whatever. Then she said that she wanted me to send her an email every morning telling her what I planned to do that day. She micromanaged everyone to the point of frustration. She then told me that I wasn’t to handle any tenant issues, but only take statements and forward to her for follow up. I was basically tied to my desk all day, following her “directives” (her favorite word). I had very little opportunity to get to know my tenants. I’m a people person, so I missed being able to interact. The tone of her emails to myself and my staff was sarcastic and condescending. We were all feeling irritated. 
At one point she told me personally in her office that I wasn’t qualified for the position. I told her the director thought I was, that’s why I was promoted. She replied that the director had given her “a blank check to do whatever she wanted”.

I applied for another job and planned to give two weeks notice, but the final straw came. My routine was to stop at the main office every morning to get my mail (one of her directives). One morning I got there about five minutes before the office opened. No one was there, but I figured they would arrive soon. I locked the door before I left for my office. I got an email about 30 minutes later from the Deputy Director of the agency, saying she heard the office was locked and no one was there. The Property Manager finally showed up about an hour later. Apparently the clerk had called in sick and the manager had locked herself out of her car with her phone inside.

The next morning when I arrived to check my mailbox, she was waiting for me. In front of everyone, she reamed me out because I didn’t stay when no one else was there. I told her I didn’t know that the clerk was out sick and she was locked out of her car. I thought they were on their way. Nothing was communicated to me. She talked to me like I was dirt under her shoes! When she finally paused to take a breath, I looked her in the eyes and asked if she was done. She said, “for now”. I replied, “so am I” and walked out the door. I immediately called the Director and told her I was done. Later that day, another member of my staff walked out. The head maintenance man put in his two weeks a couple days later.

Basically, I went from a valued employee who was trusted to get it done to a lowly worm with zero authority. It became so toxic, I hated going to work.  I’m about to start my new job working with disadvantaged youth, and I feel happy again, and not stressed.

That’s my story, sorry it’s so long."

This past spring, I found out they wanted to make my job part time - 80% of full time. This is crazy since our classes are jam packed with kids to begin with. I am also a solo parent, with 2 kids at home who will be going to college in the fall. I cannot afford a 1% pay cut, much less a 20% one! But, budgets need to be cut, so I was it. They apparently didn’t consider that I didn’t want a 20% pay cut. I also know for a fact that I was the only applicant for the position last year. So when they said I was going to be part time, I checked the current job openings for chem/science teachers in my area. There were 6 openings in our area - and I don’t even live in a very large city. 

So, I stopped in to see my boss and nicely explained that I am a solo parent with 2 kids going to college, so a pay cut was not possible, and reminded him that I was the only candidate for the job when it was full time, and, by the way… there were 6 job  openings in the area for full time science teachers. Ooops, I don’t think they saw that coming.

I told her I want to cancel it because it was 20+ min away even if I take the highway. After few min she told me to call somewhere. I had no idea how to do it so I called 24 hour thing and the lady was mad and said she will deduct points from me because I didn't cancel 24 hours earlier.

Working my shift includes working weekends while everyone else gets to leave early during weekdays already and have weekends off. I havent minded this long bc whenever I would request a day off my manager would have it covered. I rarely ask for time off and when I do its usually 1 or 2 days a month opposed to everyone taking week(s) off. Ive covered many other shifts, done clopens, worked 10 days to help accomodate someone elses schedule etc etc. Plus im crosstrained. Recently I asked for 2 separate 1 days off 1 & 3 months in advanced since I racked up my PTO and suddenly shes asking me to go ask the other 2 to see if they can cover for me since she'll be gone too. The other week was slow & closed 7/4 so they gave everyone 2 day weeks and I had to be there for 4 days working a full shift with full lists. Im honestly pretty pissed. 
My knowing and input on a project was completely ignored recently as well which left me stuck with more work. Unfortunately this job pays on the higher end in my area and for some reason no one sees  anything wrong with whats going on except my bf amd other coworker who work there (diff section). I already feel like I need a raise for dealing with this shit and its been 2 years. If all goes well with my bfs potential job I might just leave and move with him so Im trying to stick it out but this is going too far.

I work as a physical education teacher at one of those international schools for millionaires. I work 8 hours a day from Monday to Friday, and honestly, I love my job even though it's sometimes exhausting.

What happens is that this school has an athletic program that takes place after my shift, with soccer, basketball, volleyball teams, etc., that participate in some competitions. I have no interest in coaching these teams for personal reasons. I simply HATE working with competition like that, which is exactly why I became a teacher. I like using sports in the classroom.

I've been working at this company for two years now, and right when I started, the head of athletics (who isn't my boss, by the way) already said that I had to coach a team because ""it's expected that physical education teachers coach one""... Excuse me??? Expected by whom? This crap isn't in my employment contract, screw you and your crazy expectations!!! I remember that at the time I even reported this to my direct superior, and he gave me the usual ""we must commit to the company"" bullshit... Anyway, I got pissed but ended up coaching a team out of fear they would think I wasn't working hard enough. Worst decision ever, I hated every moment of it, got stressed out, and it affected even my regular classes.

In my second year at this company, I also ended up coaching for financial reasons. Yes, they pay extra for it and, to be honest, they pay quite well.

The thing is, the next school year is about to start, and fortunately, I'm in a better financial situation. I have NO interest in doing this extra work!! Screw the money, I want to have quality of life, work 8 hours a day, and go home to exercise and spend time with my wife!!! I know this crap is going to start again soon, but I've reached my limit! I'll just say I don't want to do it, and screw it! If anyone complains, I'll say it's not in my contract end tell them to fuck off!!

Should I feel bad about this? Should I feel bad for not wanting to do EXTRA work??? I am so done with this ""we must commit to the company"" bullshit, if they really want to fire me, it's not going to be the fact that I coached some stupid team that's going to change that!!!

Just to give more context, now that I've been working at this company for a while, I've seen several people doing atrocious things and nobody ever gets fired! I do my job very well, so I really think being fired for this is very unlikely.

Anyway, that's it... Opinions? Advice? Thanks, guys!!!"

It was planned like five days ago, and when it was planned I emailed my boss the days I needed off for the next week (he fucked up this month and didn’t schedule me at all???? So we’re going week by week this month.) he apparently didn’t see the email until 3:00 this morning, the day of the trip, and informed me I’m scheduled tonight and tomorrow night. When I asked if he could change it, he said he couldn’t because he needs to schedule me at least two days weekly because of my 0.6 FTE (I have Thursday and Friday off regularly and need Saturday off for a doctors appointment). Which is hilarious bc I spent the first week of this month off involuntarily, bc he didn’t reply to my calls or emails to get me on the schedule for a full 10 days. So I wonder if any action is being taken against him for not scheduling me for that time, seeing as I apparently need to be scheduled at least 2 days a week. I’m so irritated and don’t know if I’m going to stay or go. He did tell me I could call off for the two days, but I recently called off due to illness and don’t really want to have that many call offs in a short period. If I do stay home and go to work, I think I’ll be pretty apathetic and kind of upset because I emailed him on time for him to give me the time off and yet, because of his awful email checking habits, got scheduled during the days I told him I could not work.

I informed my boss of this and he is demanding I give the boots back. My question is, is it unreasonable of me to say no that I’m keeping the boots? I feel like they’re mine to keep, nobody told him he had to give us the extra money on our checks for boots and it’s not like he can return them for the money back as I’m the one that went to the store and paid for them and have the receipt so they’d most likely just be thrown away. I could see if they were company provided like they took everybody’s shoe size and then handed out boots to everyone but we basically were given a bonus with the direction to get steel toed boots. He even told us that if we already have steel toed boots to just keep the money, so I feel like this is just petty or some sort of power trip because I’m getting a new job.

I’m masked and gave a warning message ahead of time to the office that I’m not feeling well, immediately went to work in a separate room where I won’t be in contact with other coworkers and brought my hand sanitizer in here with me. If I had PTO I’d stay home but I’m contracted and have to actually make up hours from earlier this summer. 

Thanks a lot!!

My last day here is in a few weeks. Already stressed getting my things all straightened out and wrapped up. Being told by someone with extremely cushy PTO and a nice salary knowing I’m a contract employee in poverty that covid is just like the flu and people shouldn’t stop their lives over it, and finding it funny your housemate insisted it was covid despite the 2 negative tests… am I being sensitive? While working in a community engagement org and caring about equity and harm reduction.. I’m really annoyed. Am I being too sensitive/harsh? 

On Friday I found out I had two other Covid exposures and I tested negative all weekend and yesterday. So if it’s not Covid it’s probably whatever my coworker had, I haven’t seen anyone outside of work since last Monday actually because I live alone and I’m burnt out, and canceled my weekend plans to be safe.

Been firing a bunch of resumes out via Indeed and LinkedIn. This guy first called while I was eating dinner, leaving a very garbled voicemail (the transcription only picks up a few words). Okay, no biggie. I'll call him back in the morning. Then he called and hung up a little later, also sent me an email. I let him know I wasn't interested.

Now this. Every voicemail has either been garbled to the point that I can't understand it, or music. 8:15am is a little rude, 7:40am is downright harassment.

This is why I never give employers (or potential employers) my real phone # - they always get my Google Voice number."

I made the decision to change careers this year. After an almost decade long endeavor of working in childcare I decided to move into medical billing. 

  
After finishing a course and a month and a half of looking, I finally found a job at a mental health clinic. I made the mistake of giving the poor reviews on Indeed the benefit of the doubt and did not do a deeper dive into researching the company as I should. 

I am on working on week 4 and so far this place is an absolute shitshow. 

* There is no set trainer I am basically on my own with learning the system. I get more help from my coworkers than I do my boss and they have their own jobs to do.
* I was working on a broken computer for almost two weeks
* There are literal rats in the ceiling and they found a dead one in the breakroom vending machine that sat there for over a week. 
* Messed up my first paycheck
* They didn't tell a coworker who has been working before me about the clock in system and basically forgot to put in her time and pay her for a full pay period. 
* Not to mention that same coworker is a person of color and has had nasty comments made to her by a literal psychologist who has a reputation of being sexist and now they feel he might be racist too. 
* Found out this morning that this place has multiple lawsuits against them from their jail contracts where they ignored an inmates need for help and the inmate killed themselves. 

And that is just the bottom line. I was informed last night that someone complained about the state of the office to the Department of Labor and was fired for it. This was back when there was flooding in the building and the carpet began to grow mold. 

I was so eager to work here for the experience and now I am trying to find an exit strategy on top of catching up on bills due to the pay schedule change.  Not to mention pay for a wedding. I fucking hate it here.

I've put in 30 years and have clawed my way into senior management.  I have never made executive because I have a tendency to do what's right.

We got a new CEO about 9 months ago who immediately backfilled his role with his biggest crony.  Run of the mill asshattery.

The big push was an external consultant to do pay transparency so everyone could feel comfortable they were being paid fairly.

The process was slow.  It suffered many delays.  And for the first time in my career I was forced to separate pay conversations from performance reviews.   We held reviews in February and pay conversations in June.

Beyond the founding of the universe this made a lot of people mad.

So after hyping pay transparency for months and apologizing for the delay in rolling it out it should be no surprise the new CEO used this data to ensure over half the company did not get raises.  Of course there was no discussion that pay was going to be frozen this year.

People are justifiably pissed off.  I am expecting to lose at least 1/3 of my team over this.

In order to understand why everyone is upset about the new compensation process our executives have sent out a survey where they expect me to name each individual I am responsible for and state whether they are happy or not about it and why.  I already was unable to give them what I believe they are owed so why not further betray their trust in me and rat them out?

I told my C leader I report to there is no way in hell I am filling out this survey and he agreed.  He's on vacation this week and HR with the CEO on copy just sent me a reminder I am late in my responses.

Needless to say I have already started my job search."

6,2024-07-16,Good idea to take FMLA for burnout?,u/lovemydogs1969,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e4xv62/good_idea_to_take_fmla_for_burnout/,antiwork,"My spouse has been a long-term employee (30+ years) with their company. Especially over the last 5 years, the workload has become crushing. They did hire a couple of new people, but it was possibly too little, too late because even a year later it's not getting better. My spouse is working (mostly from home) on average 16-hour days and at least one day every weekend. They are salaried so no OT. This is a technical/IT position.

My spouse is experiencing signs of severe burnout. They can no longer work effectively and are taking much longer than needed on tasks due to feeling constantly overwhelmed. Their manager is constantly berating them about why they did things this way, or why isn't this done. One coworker is having anxiety attacks, but my spouse is just zoning out, having trouble sleeping due to being amped up, and having trouble waking up to start the grind another day. I am talking about months of sleeping only 4-5 hours a night, and this is affecting me as well, since I can't sleep well when my spouse is still awake. My spouse is also having some nagging health issues (headaches, neuropathy) that may be stress-related. Also, even during ""downtime"" when they are not working, they are unable to relax and enjoy life. For years now, there has been very little recreational or leisure activities. It's just work/chores/work/sleep day after day after day. They cannot get to sleep and stay wound up until 1-2 AM and then on Saturdays they sleep until noon, and then lie in bed on their phone unable to get the day started. Most Sundays are spent logged in working. My spouse barely eats because the stress is taking their appetite away. They are only exercising once or twice a week and the rest of the time sitting in a chair. I am so worried about my spouse's health.

I have tried to get my spouse to either retire (we are in our mid-50's) or to request a reduced work schedule, but they don't think it will work out. They are not quite ready to stop working (identity and purpose), they like what they do, and just want to have a regular schedule. We don't think that their workload will decrease much even with a part-time designation. My spouse is the most senior person (non-managerial) in the department and is the go-to for almost every high-level issue and every difficult problem.  
  
So I would like some opinions on if it's advisable to get a note from the doctor requesting 3 months leave for health issues. My spouse had a previous manager that was out on FMLA for a year, so I don't see why the company couldn't hold their job for 3 months just to maybe be able to finally rest and calm their nervous system. We were able to go on vacation a few months ago and spent a lot of time just catching up on sleep. But you know just a week isn't enough to really get into a relaxed state. I'm assuming that we would have to cover health benefits out of pocket since they would not have a paycheck to deduct, right? 

Is there anything else we should be thinking about? My spouse has an appointment coming up with their PCP and I'd like them to ask for a note. Hopefully the doctor wouldn't have to spell out exactly what the problem is. Can the doctor just say my patient is dealing with a health issue and we are requesting 3 months FMLA leave?"

I've had so much job trauma. I live in Iowa and receiving unemployment here is so awful. They treat you like a criminal the whole time. 

Some core memories: 

1. 2013 - My supervisor forwarded me an email thread about how due to my gender I wouldn't be able to actually do my job (I worked in the craft beer industry). I printed the email thread out, gave it to HR and was fired the following Monday for insubordination. I was then threatened with a lawsuit if I tried to get a job in my field afterwards. 
2. 2020/2021- I have had two jobs have to hire two people to replace me after I left due to the workload. 
3. 2023 - I was stalked (my supervisor showed up to a show I was performing at with an HR representative) 
4. 2023-  I was written up for attending my grandmother's funeral and was then basically accused of lying (oh your grandma died? What was her name??) 
5. 2024 - I was asked to commit a crime (sell THC flower in an illegal state) and when I refused was fired. 

These were all different jobs within a major city metro. I'm so tired. This was the first day I had to call a mental health hotline about it and I'm not 100% sure I'm gonna make it to next year. Every interview I've had has major issues with me saying I'm interested in sticking to 40 hours a week (they want a salaried employee to shoot for 50-60 hours at like $45k)

For the last 7 months I have built a small conflict with the HR department of this corporation, as they nearly got me in trouble with the IRS at the start of tax season for failing to correct issues with my W-2 and then asked for $1,000 put of my own pocket to correct it. It's July and they still haven't corrected it. This was back in January.

Either way, this isn't the main subject of this situation. While working at this company, one of the higher-ups created a group chat a few years ago for all of the receptionists to give each other moral support, a place to vent, as well as expressing frustration or asking for help from other offices in the company. After almost three years, the HR department decided today to delete the group chat and said it was ""Unprofessional and distracting"". From my point of view, this feels quite dehumanizing. This was the main place to look for moral support and help from others. It was a way to feel comforted by your peers and have a centralized place to speak with each other on issues in and out of work. It was the one thing that kept my sanity. If I had an incident with a patient that brought my mood down, that group chat was the place to cheer me up. Am I in the wrong for being upset that HR took away the group chat?

They were quick to remove me from every groups except a private social media group where all the new hires and potential new hires.

The ex_manager was manipulative, narcissistic and showed no respect. He doesn’t like people who voice opinions which are conflicting to his, he appreciates boot lickers and undermine good engineers who voice out

I decided to teach him a lesson, he didn’t remove me from the social media group where all the potential  new hire are added, I left a very long message of how this ex_manager treated me and how he bullied me and threw lot of offenders demotivating comments. Attached screenshots of all the conversation and mentioned “good luck team, may the best boot licker survive”

I have since received so many missed calls from new hires, all these hires are from top companies like google, Microsoft etc. Never attended any calls, the proof i attached on that private group was more than enough to expose what self obsessed cnt he is.

I am finally happy, planning to rest for a couple of days and start looking for a new gig. "

We discovered that farming also requires a lot of capital and that many farmers have low incomes and live unstable lives. I discovered that self-sufficiency is also difficult to sustain for a long period of time. I have seen people who practiced this kind of self-sufficiency by giving up the conveniences of modern life, but when they became weak in old age, most of them ended up returning to the city somehow.

10,2024-07-16,Manager is knowingly burning me out (long I hate work rant),u/_typhoid_mary,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e55cvc/manager_is_knowingly_burning_me_out_long_i_hate/,antiwork,"TLDR; I am forced to work alone in a busy hospital and the stress is making my hands literally numb and there is nothing I can do about it.

Sorry for the rant, I just don’t know what to do. I work at a hospital as a phlebotomist. My manager has always been very hot and cold. People who have worked with her before she became manager say she has always held grudges and doesn’t really like her job. I agree. In her defense, she applied to supervise just phlebotomy, and was roped into supervising two other departments. So I try to understand. 

I came back from maternity leave to a part time nights position. I was pressured to start working nights sooner than I was ready for under the guise of she needed to fill the position.

There are supposed to be two people working nights (200+ bed hospital, not including emergency department and surgery bays/recovery.) The night my schedule started, the other girl quit. Whatever it happens we have high turnover. 

On the nights I don’t work, there are two people, and if one ever calls out, I am asked to come work so there are two people on. I have been working alone every night aside from the occasional night one of the other girls wants to work the shift. 

We have sign ups for vacant shifts for per diems and for overtime, my nights are never posted. Like nobody knows they have the option to work those nights with me so I am not alone. 

Manager gets pressback from admin when people have too much overtime. My coworker (been there for 15 years) firmly believes manager doesn’t give people the option because I can “handle it.” I have worked in labs and been a phleb for over 7 years, do processing, do send outs, and make sure the front half of the lab doesn’t burn down. I’m happy to do it because I genuinely love my job and care about the patients. 

But it is too much. I am expected to do all of the phlebotomy draws, manage pending specimens from the ED, prepare specimens for transport to other labs, process specimens when I am not on the floors, take a mandatory 30 minute unpaid break, respond to codes, and do this all alone. I am so burnt out. When it rains it pours. I have a 4 month old at home and sleep is broken and restless at best, nonexistent at worst. I only work 24hrs a week which is the only saving grace. 

I have a complex personal medical history, and have always had a chronic b12 deficiency. This causes numbness and trembling in my hands and feet (I know it is not diabetes, but mild vitamin deficiency neuropathy.) It gets worse when I am stressed. Usually it is limited to my ring and pinky fingers on both hands, and the outsides of my forearms.

The last few nights I’ve worked I’ve been so stressed my whole hands are going numb and tingling. Phlebotomist… I am sure you can sense the issue. 

Catch is I exhausted all of my “protected sick time” back in November of 2023 from when I was still knocked up. I have scanned my company and state policy, and have no clue when those sick hours are supposed to reset. My HR shit app says I still have negative 40 hours. 

I can contact my doctor and apply for FMLA but what the fuck am I supposed to do in the meantime?? Again, manager holds grudges and really doesn’t give a shit. Two weeks ago a wonderful girl quit on the spot because manager wouldn’t give her a HALF SHIFT OFF for her godmother’s funeral. It isn’t in our “bereavement policy.” 

Idk. I just needed to vent. I hate it here.

Management has made it clear since I started that only a few of the cameras are real. Only three, to be exact. I’d definitely prefer more, but the fact that they had fake cameras didn’t perturb me since plenty of places use fake cameras for theft prevention. 

That brings us to the past few weeks. After a customer verbally and physically assaulted one of my coworkers (berating them and throwing a drink at them), one of our assistant managers reviewed the footage. Of the cameras that worked, the one behind the counter was not angled in a way where we could actually see the customers, just the employee from the neck down and the area behind the counter. Clearly, angled only for employee theft (we do not control the angle of the cameras). 

The AM emailed corporate telling them we needed the angle of the security camera changed and more real cameras so that we can have these incidents on tape in the future. Corporate’s first response was not one of compassion for the incident, but instead, “How do you know the angle of the cameras?”

As it turns out, only general managers are supposed to be able to review footage, much less know that any of the cameras are fake. Meaning 1. they do not want us to know they monitor us more than the customers, and 2. they want us to be equally as intimidated by the fake cameras as the customers are. 

Employee safety is a joke. They don’t give a shit about us. "

Sunday night my second caller of the evening told me he was going to murder me in multiple ways and rape my child. Actually he said specially he was going to “stick his dick in my babies ass and make me lick the blood off his dick” before he snapped my neck. That was after he told me he was going to put a bullet in my head and told me to give him my Instagram so he can find me and kill me. 

I worked for a 3 digit crisis line. 

The pay? $21 per hour. No benefits. 

The job?  Abuse.  I mean answering a crisis line. 

Now listen, when it was the people who
Actually needed help the job wasn’t terrible. I helped hundreds of people. 

But humans are fucking awful, and there are multiple sociopaths who call
988 over and over to abuse counselors and they are not suicidal or in crisis- they are just terrible. 
These callers are known to vibrant- but over the past few months vibrant has continued to take counselor protections away. The man that threatened me had already called three times and threatened various ways of death on other counselors but I was the lucky one to get the child rape comment. I have a daughter. 

Today (I called in last night) they called and fired me. 

Now the company that runs 988 is called Vibrant. They claim to be a non profit but they are all about getting that government money. 988 is government funded but it’s administered by vibrant who creates or
Co-ops call centers to take 988 calls. They are greedy and run lines as understaffed as they can get away with and force their centers to do whatever they say so they can keep staff. 

What do they offer for their counselors as help for taking calls? 
One hour of group counseling a month 🤣

I have a picture of my last report and can verify whatever info. 

I spoke up too much so my time was coming regardless but I wish I would
Have gotten canned before my mental health was totally destroyed. 

Don’t work for 988. The money stays at the top and they do not care about their counselors ONLY their government contracts.

Happy birthday 988.

I don't think much of it. Not sure why we're hiring since my manager has implied that they can barely afford to pay existing staff, but whatever.
Later in the evening, my boss, the owner comes in. He asks to talk for a minute and I say sure. He says did you know I'm hiring right now? I say yes, I heard there was an interview today. He's like yeah, and I saw your resume on Indeed and that it was updated a couple weeks ago. Apparently, my resume was suggested to him by Indeed because of key words and phrases or something. I say yes, it has been three years since I updated and so I did so, considering I have much more experience and skills now, but I'm not looking or applying (Which is a lie and a truth. I was close to quitting at the time and started looking, but negotiated a change in my schedule that made my job tolerable enough to stick around a little longer, at least through the season.) 
He starts to get a really condescending tone and says ""I don't know why you would need to update your resume if you're not applying."" He clearly doesn't believe me. I think it's pretty normal. My brother does the same thing. It's just something you do as you gain experience, or at least that's what I thought. Feel free to let me know if I'm wrong about that. 
Either way, I have every right to do it. But I could tell he thought I was in the wrong. In fact, he said ""I feel like I found my partner on a dating website."" Am I crazy or is that highly inappropriate? Not to mention unprofessional. He also asked me if any employers had reached out to me, which is none of his business. And when I said my brother said I should keep it up to date because he is protective of me and always wants to help me, he snarked ""Yeah, he wants to help you find another job."" What a manchild. I can't wait to leave. Any insight and advice is welcome."

I work 12 hour shifts remotely and in the office, last night I had little to no sleep due to my anxiety and i felt that I’m unable to work.

I called into the sickness line to confirm my absence and my manager rang me at 7 having a go at me for calling in sick, stating I didn’t give a proper reason on the phone line. He started pressuring me because I’m already under review because I flagged up a system that I called in sick twice in the last 6 months. He kept pressuring me asking what was wrong with me and I told him I genuinely don’t feel well to work. He said why can’t I work from home then because of the pressure he was putting into me and my anxiety going thru the roof I said okay then I will then he said well no you’ve already called in sick and that I should play the game?. 

The whole thing was incredibly unprofessional and I’ll be putting a complaint in. It just has me worried because I started to say okay I’ll work from home when I already said I’m unable to work, contradicting myself. But even then he said no I already called in sick. 

Sorry if this is typed poorly, my anxiety is really high and I’m panicking about my job. "

the situation: last week our director told us that moving forward, if a member of the management team scheduled on-site calls out sick, then one of the remote managers must volunteer to come on-site and if no one volunteers, the director or associate director will just choose someone who has to come on-site. this is rubbing me the wrong way as a policy for a few reasons:

our office is downtown and we have to pay for parking. while it’s not a huge amount, planning on not having to pay and then that changing at the last minute can be tough. additionally, for myself and many of my coworkers, commutes can be long. it doesn’t make sense to me to log on remote when our office opens and be immediately told to come on-site, logging off to get ready and commute in during work hours. i also now feel an enormous sense of guilt about needing to call out sick and putting my coworkers in this position. i’m also very confused about why this is now a policy, as my team is very passionate and will oftentimes come on-site even when scheduled remote or offer additional coverage. 

i’m not sure what advice i’m looking for, if any, but does anyone have any insight on hybrid work situations like this? i’m hesitant to complain, lest remote options be taken away entirely. "

I am thevyoubgest of a team of 5, and last to have arrived. At the beginning, I thought we were jockingly all teasing each others. Now, I feel like I'm the main target of their increasingly mean mockeries.

They make fun of me for strictly following my dieticiannary diet and not going out to eat anymore.

They asked me to stop take my electric racket to the bathroom. The women bathroom is infested with mosquitoes, some women completly stopped going because of that invasion. The client and consultants from other companies thanked me for killing a bunch of them, but now, I only dare to take my racket in a bag and not show it anymore. Plus I only take it when I go take a shower in the morning after coming to work on my bike.

They told me to stop overdoing it when I arrive super sweaty, drips rolling from my forehead, after biking for only 20 minutes.

They laugh about the bakeries I bring in for free sometimes. Last time it was homemade macaroons. As they were eating them, they made fun about how it looked like I had fallen on my way there.

Rules change constantly. Sometimes I must not give task in the reports to people who weren't at the reunion, sometimes I must. Sometimes I must just broadcast the first report and work on the planning afterwards, sometimes I must put the planning in the first report. Its not a question of context, they are the same reports every week.

Sometimes I'm overwordy, sometimes I am not wordy enough.

I feel like, in most work-related cases, it's just a question of point of view. Like : my coworker likes to write thing like X, I prefer to write them like Y, none of them are better or worst, literally the same informations are convey, and the client dont have anything to say about my way of writing things. But because I am his consultant, my coworker wants me to bend to his preferences, and consider mines as mistakes. And he makes fun of me for them, joined my my other coworker.

I am getting sick of being constantly laughed at for breathing. I haven't brought any bakeries since the macaroons even though I adore making them. I haven't share with them anything about my hobbies and points of view since they asked me when I intended to grow up and finally become an adult (I do LARP).

I work as a landscaper, this heat on my body can't take it anymore & cannot find anything else in the area that might be less physically demanding. Not even grocery stores or fast food places are hiring. 

I submitted hundreds of applications & printed out copies of my resumes, walked in person dressed nicely and left my resume/buisness cards/chatted with the employees at many places, who all desperately wanted some relief/more new hires.

Had interviews, actually was hired at a mcdonalds but then after hiring me they changed their mind and said ""Actually, we are full staffed and not hiring."" (corporate doesn't want to give them staff and relief despite them being understaffed) 

I need a job that is less physically demanding but nowhere is hiring & I have stooped so low in looking for everything and anything. I am pre diabetic and taking medications that make me physically ill, I need to have bathroom access and with my current job I don't have bathroom access. We have to pee in people's yards behind bushes or drive to the nearest gas station for poo.

Being a female? Its very uncomfortable & I feel filthy afterwards, but I suck it up. 

Naturally I would have to drive far to get to the bathroom, and if I am going too often I might get pay docked for not being at the client's property/the client gets mad or my bosses may get mad. They seemed frustrated with me for having to leave early because I almost fainted a few times from the heat and my medicine making me *this* close to vomiting.

I feel like the wealthy boomer clients we serve would be more angry and feel disgusted with me for vomiting and fainting on their property.

Idk what to do. No remote or office jobs are hiring around me either. I have done everything right and I am trapped in a work enviroment that I can't physically handle anymore. "

I have all the relevant information in the automatic response (who to contact in my absence, etc.). I'm a bit confused why does she think she can control how I format emails. I have extensive work experience, and I know how to write f* emails. Both of them control basically everything. I'm having nightmares about my job regularly. First of all, I'm on sick leave. Secondly, I'm not going to change it as per her stupid template. 
Is it normal that a manager dictates how to write my out of office template?

For years I was absolutely mentally and physically drained at work.  I graduated college during the recession and despite a graphic design degree couldn’t find anything that did require so many years of experience nor could I afford to pack up and move to a giant city.  So I took what could find. I worked at Lowe’s for 4 years and it was miserable. It’s retail. The hours sucked. Despite being a reliable worker, I kept getting passed up for promotions yet expected to do everyone’s else job because they wouldn’t hire proper staff.  For years I jumped around a few other jobs but I just couldn’t cut it. I was lucky that I didn’t have massive student loans to pay off but I had a husband and a small house. Things got tight so I went to work at a call center. Believe it or not it wasn’t that bad for the first couple years I worked and I had a great team of people but then as you can imagine, things restructured and it was miserable again.

After nearly 10 years of just hating the idea of working, my husband got a great job that paid well and had excellent benefits and I just felt at ease no longer in this endless cycle of going from one miserable job to another. Constantly job hunting etc.  I had my daughter so my days were filled with caring for her and taking care of the house.  Once she started school I started doing volunteer work which was very fulfilling.

My husband’s job was with the military and after 10 years he had to retire because of back problems.  Now he’s getting decent severance pay and VA money DSP I said “you worked your ass off for 10 years. Let me work now.” I did dread going back after so long and I did NOT want to go back to retail if I could avoid it.  I applied with a temp service and my first job was actually working at a Casino cleaning the gaming floor which was pretty low stress. Wipe machines, empty trash, check the bathrooms, etc.

But then I got offered this great job working for the housing authority.  It’s close to my house, the pay is decent and Everyone is nice. It’s not too stressful most of the time and I get to help people.

So I just want to say, I’ve been in the anti work mindset and I consider myself lucky but don’t give up and things will work out somehow"

I work at a big Fortune 500 company, where I started my first job two years ago. Last year, one of the managers on the floor asked around the office if anyone knew how to use photo editing programs. Eager to help, I mentioned that I graduated from art academy and knew the ins and outs of Adobe Creative Cloud. The manager quickly requested access for Photoshop, and within a couple of days, I had it up and running on my device.

Initially, it started with simple edits here and there, but soon this manager, along with multiple other team managers, began reaching out to me for various graphic projects. I even created posters for individual team-building events!

I wouldn't have had any issue with this if graphic design was my only job. Unfortunately, I was expected to do my regular tasks in addition to editing, drawing, and printing any creative task any random manager thought of. In a nutshell, I was working two jobs at the same time, which resulted in a huge burnout as I continuously logged overtime after overtime.

After a year of this torture, I finally decided that I couldn't and wouldn't do this anymore, and I revoked my Photoshop license on my own. I then had to explain to my manager, as well as multiple other managers, that I simply couldn't do two jobs within an eight-hour workday any longer. I even suggested they hire some of my colleagues who graduated with me and were looking for creative jobs or had their freelance gigs. The only response I got was that they didn't see the point in hiring anyone when people within the company could do just fine. I was seething!

Not only were they overworking me to my limits, expecting me to work two jobs while getting a paycheck for one, but in hindsight, I also took someone's graphic design job. Someone looking for exactly that kind of job didn't get it because it was cheaper to overwork me and pay me only for what's in my contract.

I was definitely too eager to please at my first job and agreed to everything without thinking too much about it. The bottom line is, never do something you're not getting extra pay for!

To this day, the managers who were commissioning countless projects now don't even acknowledge me when I bump into them. It's as if I offended them or asked for something absolutely outrageous when I denied their requests and asked to focus only on my work tasks."

Have you ever wished for a way to earn passive income without much effort? Traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and securities often require a long wait for returns, sometimes up to a year or more. But I recently discovered a more immediate opportunity: blockchain testing with EOS coin. It’s incredibly straightforward, and you receive payments just 10 minutes after each transaction.

**Here’s how it works:**

* By creating transactions within the EOS coin’s blockchain system, you help identify and fix system issues, earning coins as a reward. You get 0.5% of your transaction amount as profit. For instance, I make transactions worth $1000 and earn $100 a day. Your earnings depend on how much you invest.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. Purchase EOS coins on the spot market using USDT.
2. Navigate to Wallet, click on Deposit, and note your memo. This is needed for the blockchain to know where to return the coins.
3. Instead of Deposit, choose Withdraw and input the required information: network (EOS), memo (your memo), testing address (bonus.eos), and the number of coins.
4. Send the coins and get them back with a 0.5% reward.
5. Repeat the process from step 2 up to 20 times a day (the daily limit).

It's genuinely simple and user-friendly. Even my friends, who were new to crypto, are already making money. If you need a detailed guide, **feel free to message me directly**. I'll be happy to answer any questions. And when you start earning, maybe treat me to an iced latte!"

I’ve won awards and received glowing feedback from my team members and managers. I’m really good at it despite having bad social anxiety and being very introverted. People like me though because I listen, empathize and fight for team members to have better working conditions. However, being a leader gets harder and harder as companies take away benefits despite record profits, lay off employees, refuse to hire enough staff, etc. I have to lead a team who is being stretched so thin and there is only so much I can do, which isn’t enough. I’m being stretched thin myself, and now I find myself some days just frozen at work, unable to make any progress on my tasks (burn out). I can’t take more time off because even though we have “unlimited PTO” I have utilized it more than other team members and have been asked to stop. For reference, the average person at my company has only taken 7 days off this year so far and that is what they compare me to. That’s so little! Most of my time has been used for doctor and vet appointments, sick days or a trip for a funeral. I haven’t had actual “vacation” and now I can’t, even though I’ve had no issues meeting all of my deadlines. 

I put on an act everyday at work of being this happy and positive person but I am so miserable. I need my job though because I can’t pay my mortgage and bills without it and need health insurance. The job market is brutal right now so I would be spending a lot of energy for a long time trying to get something comparable in pay. I haven’t had a job yet that didn’t have large workloads so I also wonder if looking is even worth it, or if I would just be exploited somewhere else. 

I can’t imagine doing this another day, much less the majority of my life as working conditions likely continue to get worse as companies replace workers overseas or with AI. As executives demand higher profits year after year without returning any of it back to employees. As my health continues to decline but expectations rise. 

My boss takes PTO but continues to work because it gives them time to work on their tasks uninterrupted so they can catch up. Fucking ridiculous. 

Fucking hopeless. "

I work in social services and recently quit my job at the youth residental program I've worked at for a year and a half. I love the company but hate the job I just quit. We have other facilities that are close by me, all with different directors that hopefully run their programs better than my last. I actually got these interviews through my regional director because we had a phone conversation about the reasons I was quitting at my last program/what issues he should be looking into and if I'd be interested in going else where. 

So on to the question, how do I answer the dreaded question of why did you quit your last job? I'm hoping that having this reference from my regional director gives me a leg up, but I'm not sure. I feel like my options are: lie to them, make something up but they may also ask the regional director and he could tell them I was very unhappy in my previous program. Or I'm honest but in a professional way ex: ""I felt as though my skills weren't being utalized"" ""my values did not align"" ""I felt as though I couldn't work to the best of my ability due to issues within the program""

Yet every time I regret finding a job.

Lest time, I was working as a dishwasher in a busy restaurant for 10-12 hours a day, but my coworkers were making me do all the prep work and some of the cleaning, so I never got a minute to rest between washing the dishes and doing other, unrelated work. My boss told me I am only supposed to clean the dishes but one conversation with my coworkers and he changed his mind and told me to listen to them. Then I asked if I can get more money, because I'm doing more work - he said no. So I was still earning less than minimum wage. I lasted only two weeks, because I was constantly overworked, slept most of my time at home and when I wasn't sleeping I was constantly worried about work.

This year was supposed to be different. My mum spoke to her friend and I've landed a job in a motel. Before I started I was told I will be working in the kitchen and that sometimes I will go and clean the rooms. What I didn't know then, was that I was supposed to: be a waitress, prepare all of the dishes, do motel reservations (pick up calls, manage booking platform), clean the kitchen, be a dishwasher and sometimes clean the rooms. And also, I was supposed to train to replace my coworker who was doing all of that alone, so she could go on vacation. Today was my third day and she was supposed to train me for everything but she was a bitch at every step of it. Then dinner rush came in and I got lost when preparing soups as I haven't worked in kitchen as a cook before. She them proceeded to tell me that I'm useless and that she won't get her vacation and such things and I cried a little, because I sometimes do when stressed. Then apologized but did my job anyways, even though I didn't really know what to do. I was washing dishes, making food and cleaning. Then she asked me to serve the food but I didn't know who ordered what, as in this workplace they don't write that down. Then our boss came in, so I asked if I could talk to her alone and told her about how I feel and then my coworker got all bitchy and told her I am basically a failure and that they'd be better of without me. So I then thought that if she says that at the beginning of my training, what would she say if I made a mistake a week, month after? And how is one person, working summer job, supposed to learn to do all of these things alone? So I decided to quit, because of the workload and people I worked with. Now, I am again jobless. 

I wonder, was it right decision though? "

129,2024-07-17,My boss took my resignation too personally,u/Affectionate_Key82,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5o0ot/my_boss_took_my_resignation_too_personally/,antiwork,"Tdlr; boss gaslighting, passive aggressiveness, late wage payment

So basically, a year ago I freshly graduated and was looking for a job to fill in my now empty schedule. In a short matter of time I was hired, though the pay was lower than I agreed because prior to this I already had 5+ years of experience. Though decided to go through with it seeing this as only temporarily before I go onto something better.

I'm well aware that I'm still new to the 'real world' and can be rather naive. Given that I like to make people happy and be kind of a pushover (still working on this aspect of myself). My employer was very nice and my time working in the company was good and all, hence my decision to leave was never out of unhappiness.

Until another company reached back out to me, offering me better pay which was something I was looking for. I was already working four days a week in my current job, one of the day was NOT marked in my contract (as it was added after I signed it) hence I thought I'd ask my boss to give me just that one day back so I can work elsewhere. I checked my papers and read over my contract, making sure I followed the procedures such as giving a notice ahead of time. After that, I confronted my boss about my decision, and boy, they were NOT having it. 

As much as I tried to keep the situation civil and professional, the entire conversation I felt as if words were being put in my mouth. Mentioning how I should feel guilty for leaving and the clients would feel upset, how I didn't care about the 'damage' being left, and when I told them I DO care (it's just that I have bills to pay!), they countered by saying caring is ""action"". I knew what that meant, as in an indirect way of saying I shouldn't bother and just stay because it's still 'my fault'.

That was such a RED FLAG to me. I managed to get my one day back but through the rest of the year, I was already considering terminating the contract altogether. It didn't help when my 'super nice and gentle employer' suddenly became unapproachable and tossing annoyed glances when I tried to do my duty as a good employee. I started to have gaps in my schedule as they no longer let me know changes in it ahead of time (I don't get paid for those gaps btw) and just overall, less care to my end of things. It was just a complete 180 for me and I could tell they were harboring angry emotions at my direction. The hints were obvious. 

So I resigned completely. It was also the same month I was leaving for vacation. My boss told me I could pick up my cheque after I came back from vacation. Though my flight was two weeks after the day of my leave but my naive self accepted the terms, fully believing they'd hold their word for it. We agreed I'd just text them asap when I return and I'd drop by to pick up my payment.

Left on read twice in a span of two weeks. And I'm getting my payment next month.

I confronted them again about how I disagreed with this. The entire conversation did not go well as they were talking over me and blaming me for the mess 'I' made because now they had to find 3 employees to take my place last minute. Even when I tried to get a better understanding of the situation, I'm either cut off or blamed again, which is obvious that they don't care about the righteousness of the situation but having things their way. (Which is funny because they accused my of taking things my way).

I just want to know whether I made the right decision to deal with a matter like this correctly. I know how resignations work as it should be given notice ahead of time. I know that late wages are unacceptable, should be given within 6 days after resignation. Heck my new workplace accidentally forgot to pay me but were 100% transparent with everything! In the end I'm quite frustrated and angry of why things turned out this way and overthinking whether I did do something wrong. Please help!"

I have it personally in my wallet and never give it out to anyone. There is a different credit card that lives in the boss's safe. It is an former employee's company card. It has the company on the card and his name. My department uses this former employee's card regularly for company purchases. 

I am soon quitting. I don't know how to make sure they cancel my account. Honestly, I don't know if I would be financially responsible for anything on my company card after I leave, but I definitely don't want a card or account with my name on it floating around for new employees to use. I still am in possession of the card. 

My job responsibilities have not included going online and doing anything finance related on my account. I have submitted my receipts and labeled them when turning them into my boss, but I'm really not sure what she does with them after that.

12,2024-07-17,Hyper Focus on Words,u/Marsnineteen75,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5pwcz/hyper_focus_on_words/,antiwork,"As the title suggests, I am sitting here thinking about the stressful job I have. For context, I am an Iraq combat vet, and thought that after that deployment in 05-06 with the 101st, life would be downhill and easy comparitively. However, I have found myself in a job that while not Iraq bad, is bad in its own ways. For one, Iraq was a short period of my life with an abrupt end, all being considered, whereas now, I see no escape.

 I digress though because I want to rant about a very particular stressful part. I am now a clinical administrator (means i do both clinical work and oversee others clinical work at a hospital). One particular part of my job I hate is having to word every statement as carefully as I can. Just when I think I have, for example, a meeting or an email I have to adress people in, I have to worry about how every single word or statement will be perceived like many here have probably had the displeasure of experiencing. 

Concerning this, I will often run my statements or emails by someone I trust, and even after a lot of thought in my original, they will be like, ""well I would take this out. I wouldn't say this because it will be perceived xyz..I would change this..Oh don't do that"" etc. I think I am an empathetic administrator and part of why I even took the job, when I knew I would prefer just being a front line clinician only, was to not be the bosses I have had. That unfortunately has a whole other issue I could write about, which is I am looked at as weak in the power dynamics of the other supervisors because I try to play nice.

 The issue with commincation, isn't limited to this position.  I have always had to worry about it, but just more now. Most of it has to do with fragile egos, speaking truth to power, or miscommunication, or just how working with a bunch of doctors and clinicians, everything seems to have to be intellectual mind games and challenges including a lot of gaslighting by people who should know better. My job priority is taking care of clients, which is tough job sometimes, so to have to worry about using one statement that might send a doctor into narcissistic rage because they misinterpreted something or disagree with you, really sucks.

 The medical field in the US where I am at, is absolutely horrible on every level, but you tell yourself you do it because you are helping people , or at least I do, but the reality is, you get dependent on the system (housing, car, food, entertainment, medical bills, kids expenses), so you feel stuck unfortunately in a job a lot of people probably think they would like to have. That latter part was me because as a veteran, father, husband, someone in recovery from certain things, I had a passion to help. Problem is, I see for at least 60 percent of my coworkers, don't give a damn about helping and are the lazy people that the rest of us have to pick up the slack.

 I am looking for a new job now, which entails again, putting together a resume package where you really have to watch every word, and most here have likely experienced. I can't help but feel if I find a new job, it will be just more of the same."

27,2024-07-17,"“Take vacation, you’ve earned it” and then don’t pay me for all of it. ",u/jayellkay84,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5qbew/take_vacation_youve_earned_it_and_then_dont_pay/,antiwork,"For context, I’ve been working for the same restaurant chain for nearly 9 years and in management for 3. I’m not the typical of this sub - I generally don’t mind working overtime. I prefer to stay busy. In 9 years I’ve only used vacation three times: Once when the restaurant was closed for nearly a week due to a hurricane, once when I went to part time and my boss used it to pay me full time hours for a few weeks, and once when upper management agreed to pay it out when a COVID case in the restaurant caused me to be let go from my second job. Also I’m technically salary but because I’m under the threshold, I’m classed as a non-exempt employee and still get paid overtime for any hours worked over 50 per week. 

The one thing I don’t like about my job is late nights. I typically have 2 closes per week. I hd made a specific request for those two days I normally close to be day shifts or half days - but if I was still going to have to close that week not to bother, it defeated the purpose. I tried to take that a few months ago for my birthday but the person who would have been covering my shifts quit abruptly. So I carefully picked a week, over a month out, where working half days would benefit me. Again I made it clear if I still had to close, don’t bother. Instead I was scheduled for 48 of my contracted 50 hours and a close on Monday instead of Wednesday and Thursday. I ended up even coming to meet with the district manager over this and some other issues that were not being properly addressed (unpaid, mind you). I ended up having another team member volunteer to stay while I left early that night. All told I worked 42.27 hours that week of my allotted 50. 

The next week I came in (originally to drop off product, which I do occasionally on the agreement I get a soda) and ended up working 3.5 hours on my day off. I compensated by leaving early the next day. So all told I was over about 1.5 hours. 

Today I get my check. It’s $40 shorter than normal. And I realize I’ve only been paid for 6 of my vacation hours. 

I’m still waiting to hear back from the district manager but I can only imagine she hopped me because of the extra overtime. 

And I’m pissed. They tried to bully me into taking vacation time for jury duty (which ended up being canceled days before and then she got mad for me covering a shift to make it up). Now I’ve made 2 extra trips to work, using my gas, not always getting my meal benefit and nothing to show for it. 

I can’t wait to finish my project management certification and get the hell out of here. "

13,2024-07-17,Crazy story about my Korean company.,u/Azn_Drifter88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5qmin/crazy_story_about_my_korean_company/,antiwork,"Hold on tight, folks. This is a long and crazy Korean company drama,

  
For my sake, I will not reveal the company's name and will use fake names.

So we had our new CEO transfer from Korea about 4-6 months ago. Before he came to America, some employees had bad feelings since we heard so many stories about our new CEO, including the fact that he said all of us at the American branch were lazy and got paid way too much. It's funny now I think about it because I thought this was my biggest issue with this CEO.

**The Beginning**

It started when he announced that he was bringing a logistic manager named Maya, who he had worked with, to join us for training for 3 months. I did not overthink it because a new CEO meant a different policy and many other ""new"" things. Later, we learned from Wayne from accounting that she would be a permanent member, and he had set aside funds for her visa. This was not a big issue for me, but I needed clarification about why he would lie. Little did I know this was the beginning of his Madness.

  
**The Great Exodus**

*Sabrina, Logistic*

She quit before the CEO even arrived. She had dealings with him before and decided to leave this company before Madness began. An additional note: Maya replaced her.

*Wayne,  Accountant* 

The CEO was really harsh on him and always told him he was not good at this job during meetings in front of people. We still don't know why the CEO thought Wayne was not good at his job, but Wayne suspected he was being managed out because he knew too much about the CEO and his shady activities. (I did not ask him the details of it; all I know was that the CEO was doing something a CEO should not do)

*Abby, Marketing* 

Unfortunately, I do not know much about Abby's issue, but I only know that the CEO told Abby that she was not good at her job and that the CEO lectured her about how she should do her job in every meeting and told her she was doing it all wrong. Mind you, Abby has a decent amount of experience in marketing, while the CEO originally came from and only knows the Logistics.

*Jocelyn Logistic*

The nicest person I know. She was on maternity leave when the CEO came to America, but she heard all the horror stories about the CEO before she came back. She was always optimistic until the CEO started his usual ""you are not good at your job,"" and from what I know, he even yelled at Jocelyn. Very unprofessional. So she decided to give two weeks' notice, but the CEO was being his usual self and started screaming, so she told the CEO what she wanted to say and walked out that day.

*Sarah Accountant*

Sarah was next, but she did not quit; she was fired. She wanted to use her PTO/Sick Day one day and told the new Account manager, Ginger. The next day, when Sarah came back, she was called to the CEO's office and told that she was being fired because she did not feel sorry for the company when she decided to take her day off... 

*Emma Marketing*

She quit when Sarah was fired. I think she did what everyone wanted to do, she walked up to CEO said the firing was unjustified and walked out.

Now, you might think that's not too many people, but give or take, we had 10-13 people working at this company, so half of the employees left within 4 months of this new CEO. 

**Hypocrisy and the Civil War**

So, remember I mentioned that the CEO started his tour of destruction by telling us we get paid too much? Well, as soon as he arrived, he complained that America was too expensive and he did not get paid enough. (Mind you, HQ pays for his house, car, living expenses, etc) The company was divided because the CEO had people he liked and favored, and when I said favored, he would have company dinner with them and them only, gave them special treatment. 

So, the people I have mentioned above, other than Sabrina, were still working for the company at this moment, myself included, and started to go on coffee runs after lunch and walk around the office together. CEO did not like that at all and accused us that we are making a ""team"" and we should ""hang out"" with everyone in the company. He started to have 1 on 1 meetings with who he thought was in this ""team"". From what I heard from other people before they left, the theme was the same. 

In one of my 1 on 1 meetings with the CEO, (YES I had multiple 1 on 1 with him about the same topic), He told me we should come to work not to make friends but to work and then started to tell me I should include Maya (One of his favored people) and other people on coffee runs and walks, and even told me to hangout with them after work... I remember telling him I used to hang out with Maya and others when she first came to America, but they did not ask me to go out after work anymore for whatever reason. CEO told me I should ask them. Mind you, I am a guy, and all my co-workers are girls except the CEO at this point. So I told him It is very weird for me to ask girls for drinks because I don't want to look like a creep. He said there is something wrong with me and told me it is not creepy at all. He and I discussed similar topics for the rest of the meeting, and he kept telling me I was wrong. At the end of the meeting, he left with this comment. **""You should start doing what I said, or I might have to do something I don't want to do.""** I don't know what that means, but it sounded like a threat.

I think I have told enough about my new CEO, and to end this story, I will bring you guys to the current day; I am the only one left from the ""team,"" and I am outcasted. I found this funny because when everyone was here, he always told us he wanted everyone to get along, but now I am the last one left; he barely even talks to me, lol. 

I have omitted many other details to make this story as short as possible. So, I want to hear what you guys think of this CEO. Thank you for reading my story; I apologize for being so long."

Recently, our old manager and old HR rep left, leaving two different people in their positions.  In regards to the manager, we've had some issues with him in that he doesn't really know the proper ins and outs of how things run smoothly, be we suddenly got hit with a big issue brought up by both him and our HR.

Apparently, the way payed time off (PTO) was done, was not the way it was done in the now ten year old handbook.  We used to have a lot more leniency in how we could request PTO, but now that leniency is completely gone.

The main issue is that now, if we miss even one day without putting in for PTO ahead of time, we are given a strike and six strikes is the limit.  This wouldn't be too big of a deal if it weren't for life just getting in the way such as a flat tire, family emergency, or court summons.  We would have to predict when events like these may happen and put in PTO or take a leave of absence, of which may incur a strike if HR deems it acceptable to do so.

Now, many of the locals who work here are single parents, dual working parents, and/or exconvicts on parole.  Thus, these people would have to put in time off for the multiple situations that they're in.  Accounting for actual vacations as well as anything else, that supply of PTO could run dry very quickly, meaning that the company is going to lose a lot of people very quickly because of this.

The nonlocals aren't really affected by this, they are from Mexico originally and they don't really have as many of the issues that us locals run into while here in the states because they live in dorms nearby, meaning they are within walking distance and their families are FAR away.  So, this policy doesn't really negatively affect them as it will with us.

The worst part is that they then told us contradictory information as well as try to throw our supervisors under the bus for not telling us even though they also only learned recently.  Overall, it's a huge mess that is going to cause them to lose a lot of good hard workers because they only have business sense rather than any common sense.

I just needed to get that off my chest and this seemed like the best subreddit to do it.  I can only hope and pray that something changes to make this situation a little easier or that I can get myself a new job that isn't so anti-worker."

And she thinks she'll fix that by forcing me to work with them more.,u/metalmankam,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5w7ih/my_boss_told_me_the_rest_of_the_team_doesnt_like/,antiwork,"I work at a large campus with multiple buildings. I have a desk mate. I've worked in several buildings around campus in my 2 years here so I've met most of the team. I have a new supervisor and we just had our first evaluation meeting. They score us in 4 categories, one of them being ""people"" referring to how I interact with coworkers and clients. That area was my lowest score. That tracks, as I am very introverted and don't like people. But I gotta pay my bills.

So in our meeting she told me we need to improve my ""people"" score. She said to be mindful of how I talk to coworkers because multiple people have told her they don't like working with me because I'm ""too negative and bring down the mood when I complain about the company."" She said I've badmouthed the company to people and it's ruined their day because they realized my complaints are accurate and it makes them also dislike this place. 

So to ""fix"" this low score, she wants to move me around to different buildings each week so I get to interact with more people. You know, the people who told her they don't like me. She thinks diving head first into things I'm bad at is the only way to get better so by forcing me into this uncomfortable situation it will give me better people skills. 

I don't really give a shit that they don't like me. She clearly said it's not that I suck, people just thought this place was awesome until I opened their eyes. I don't want to be friends with these people, I just have to work here and pay my bills. But why the fuck is she forcing me to be around them and how will that make anything better?? 

She also said she had hoped that my desk mate and I would hit it off and become best work buds but because that didn't happen, I'm not a good fit in this space. We're both just quiet introverts and don't talk much. We get all our work done, residents are happy with us. We're just not two peas in a pod having the time of our lives at the desk. And she thinks that's a problem. I can tell you right now it will be WORSE at other buildings. Especially knowing they told her they dont like me. I don't even know why she decided to tell me this. She could have just let it be and I wouldn't be around most of the team and things would be fine as they are now. At least she didn't fire me I guess. (She probably didn't fire me because this team is bleeding workers left and right and they can't hire people fast enough)"

We had a few other planned departures recently whose replacements are still gaining their feet and our management team in general is pretty swamped with these transitions. This manager leaving is a bit of a blindside to management as the departing employee was a large part of the training for the new hires. 

These projects are out of my pay-grade, categorically not the scope of my position, and would be super easy to see through to completion. Management is hoping I will take on these projects so that they can focus on getting the new hire's up to speed, and know that I will not do so for free. They have come to me and asked if I am willing to, and how I would like to be compensated if so. I don't know how to value it; it will all be while I am on the clock making my normal wage. One suggestion is maybe i get time and a half or double time for hours logged on those projects. Specifically, my manager and skip-level who presented this said that they want compensation clear and approved by corporate before I start on them. 

 Does anyone have any ideas on how i might value this work?"

15,2024-07-17,"Boss has started treating me like shit and making senseless demands, often contradictory, and smothered in nonsense jargon - am I being muscled out?",u/lu_avsgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e5xfqr/boss_has_started_treating_me_like_shit_and_making/,antiwork,"I do a borderline administrative marketing role - at least that’s what appealed to me about it when I took the role almost 2 years ago. There’s some opportunities to drive growth, but mainly, it’s been about ensuring things are accurate and up to date, and maintaining a level of appearance - not about EXPONENTIAL GROWTH, TARGETS, PERFORMANCE. I’m a team of one with no budget, minimal resources, and by no means am I the super star of the company, hell even the marketing team. I’ve always been fine with that. I do my job as best I can and try to influence things I can control/do something about. The rest - I leave it to the “top performers and rockstars”. 

Well lately it’s like a switch has flipped and my boss has no patience or tolerance for me at all. There’s no pleasantries, no acknowledgment of humanness, it’s just pure business speak - most of which makes no sense, genuinely baffles me, and comes with absolutely no consistency. I get sent from pillar to post on hare brained endeavours every other week (god forbid we just stick to one USP and try to do it well with integrity - it’s all about creating exponential viral growth, by any means necessary, with absolutely no budget or resources). Apparently the company used to be happy with “top 5% employees”, but now standards have raised and the expectation is for “top 1% employees” 👍

Now I’ve had my worst ever review, they seem genuinely beyond irritated by me and my “lack of ownership and impact” and when I try to ask questions for clarity and guidance, in a situation where there’s very little I can directly control or even influence, I just get told jargon business babble which gets me exactly nowhere. I have to wonder if it’s designed to simply wear me down and encourage me to leave.

Today I was bluntly told I need to “take ownership”  and come back with a strategy, my quarterly review was poor, all my efforts to simply take the feedback on board constructively were basically trashed and it feels like a done deal that my days are numbered. 

My people pleasing tendencies are telling me to resign, which I assume they want, but my wisdom is saying fuck that, if they want you to leave, make them say it out loud, give them hell, this is bullshit and they know it. I’ve never stopped trying to do everything I realistically can, but I have a practicality which won’t allow me to do insane things to meet the outrageous demands and targets which are pulled out of thin air.

How would you handle the situation? Ideally I would keep the job, but being set up for constant failure and feeling like chopped liver is demoralising.

I asked this woman for training equipment on the product. give me something that'll teach me more about the product. she sent me to the companies YouTube page, it had one wordless video that was a commercial. how. is. that. teaching. me. in my first week she gave me a small assignment, 5 questions, that helped with part numbers. I asked her THREE times for more and she has yet to provide it. 

  
she went on a local sales call, I was dumbfounded when she didn't bring me. aint you supposed to be mentoring me? you didn't think I'd wanna learn about that sales call? okay maybe she didn't wanna bring me. that's fine. but she also doesn't explain at all what she's doing.

Recently, my team was moved to a new department with a 5-day in-office policy. When it was first announced, I immediately filed an ADA accommodation request to continue working from home. For all intents and purposes, my request was denied. The “accommodations” they offered were insulting.

I’ve been doing my best to make it work, but it’s killing me. 

Not accounting for holidays, I calculated I’d be putting 40k miles on my car in a year, which is beyond absurd. My conservative estimate on gas costs would be 5% of my take home pay, and I’d be paying something like $1300 a year for oil changes, not to mention the other accelerated wear and tear.

I asked if it is allowed to simply take a 30 minute lunch break instead, since if I'm not getting paid for 30 of those minutes, I might as well use them to not be at work!

I clearly would like to stay with the company and continue working remotely, but I just don’t want to move from where I am. The biggest reason for not wanting to move is I like where I live and my friends/family/long term girlfriend are all here. Also, I became a homeowner in 2021 and my interest rate is a meager 2.7%. If I was to sell my house now I would have to pay way more for rent something 1/3 the size of my house and also I wont be able to be a homeowner again for a long time due to the exorbitantly high interest rates right now. The last point I’d like to make is I’ve been a remote employee for the last 4 years and can do my job from home, moving across the country is not going to make a difference

How do I go about this conversation? I understand it isn’t a good look to have this conversation with my boss two weeks before Im supposed to be there and especially when I told her just 6 weeks ago I’m still coming. But if she says no then I can just put in my two weeks notice and start looking for a new job. I really enjoy the work I’m doing and I feel Im finally at the point where I can bring real value to the company so I’d love to work something out with the company to stay where I am.

The last point I’ll make is there is a guy in the group who is the same age as me and has the same time in the industry as me, but the majority of his work has been in this subject matter specifically whereas it’s all new to me. He lives 1 hr away from work and he works from home 4 days and is in office 1 day."

7,2024-07-18,The finale: worst management I ever worked for,u/giantessshay,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e62i4v/the_finale_worst_management_i_ever_worked_for/,antiwork,"I posted the 2nd and 3rd worst already but this one pales in comparison to the other two. So bad that allegations against my former boss by the staff came to a 17 page long double sided document (and that was the condensed version).

I used to work for a summer camp. I had attended it as a kid, volunteered as a teenager, then got hired in uni as an Archery/Canoe instructor. About 2 years ago I got re-hired as the assistant director. 

Unfortunately for me I didn’t know the real reasons why. 

I had never worked with the director myself, only seen him around since he was a very hands off manager. Only showed up when he absolutely had to.

It led me to doing his job, my job, and he didn’t hire a chef so I did that too. He approved the registrar to take a vacation during camp so I learned her job and added that to my number of hats for a few weeks too. 

But then I learned he only hired me as a scapegoat. He believed only women were supposed to be good with children but none of the female staff stayed on site so he wasn’t allowed to abandon the campsite as usual. 

When I found out what was going on behind the scenes I realized that meant if anything happened with the campsite it would be put on my permanent record with the organization and I would be liable so I said ""well I’d better be allowed to fire anyone if needs be.""

I couldn’t and there were two that really needed to be fired. 1. A counsellor who I realized was on drugs while doing his job (if he was even around to do his job) and another, a suspected p*dophile who didn’t do his job at all anyway.

It took me 7 weeks out of the 8 the camp ran for to get the director to fire the second one but the first one? When I said there was a problem with him the director said ""the only problem we have here is you off your (ADHD) medication."" 

I took a quick breather then got back to work but it was a nightmare of him micromanaging everything that didn’t matter, and leaving me without any assistance on major issues. 

I had to balance the budget without being given the costs of materials /or/ the budget, manage the staff, force him to deal with the s*xual harrassment claims against him by the staff, force him to follow worksafe standards and labour laws… the list goes on. 

The funniest part was his ""misplacement"" of $48,000 which I found out because he accidentally sent me the budget. I should stress it’s not embezzlement or anything illegal. 

He owned the camp and was entitled to any money leftover after expenses. The reason he lied about budget was because he liked to claim he was a volunteer and because we’d be less likely to stick to a budget if we knew there was that much left over. 

Anyway. Needless to say I wouldn’t go back there again."
9,2024-07-18,Potential Employer just slighted/insulted me because I asked for help with a 'task' they gave me. What to do?,u/edwardsamson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e62kgj/potential_employer_just_slightedinsulted_me/,antiwork,"Important to note for this that I am autistic. Level 1 ASD. As someone on the spectrum when I'm given instructions, I do my best to follow them exactly. Especially in this case when its for a potential employer deciding if they want to hire me or not. Also this job posting was for a part-time remote IT job where I'd be on call and get dispatched to customers. No real schedule just on call. 

Had a quick phone interview yesterday with this guy (the owner). Went great. Then he gives me a task for after the call. He tells me to write down the instructions and follow them closely.

The instructions were to use calendar software to create my 'ideal schedule' and then use the software's function to turn it into an image and send him that image. He specifically said both to use the calendar software and to use its export to image function. 

I didn't find much for calendar software that didn't require payment. I figured out a way to do the schedule itself with google calendar but I checked the whole site and couldn't find a way to export it to an image. 

So I email him to ask if he has an suggestions on what I should use. 

His response seemed very insulting but I need someone else to confirm it was meant as a dig at me or if I'm just overreacting.

His response was: ""You can just take a screenshot and crop it. Do you have experience with Windows?"" 

Like I'm a 34 year old whose been using Windows my entire life. I have 5 years of experience running an IT department that used Microsoft products on my resume that included using Windows Server. We literally talked on the phone about how I installed Microsoft Lync into my company's environment back in 2011. It should be fucking obvious I have Windows experience. So to me, I can't take that any way other than as an insult. As if he was saying ""you're telling me you don't know how to take a screenshot? Have you ever even used a computer???"" 

Like motherfucker, I specifically thought of taking a screenshot but I was going by your instructions that said to use the software's function to create the image. Also why the fuck does it have to use calendar software? I can't just tell you my ideal schedule in words...or use a spreadsheet? 

Anyways am I right to be royally pissed off at this guy? Should I send him an email telling him I'm autistic and grill him for trying to follow his own stupid ass instructions?"

This manager is always stressed and yelling in front of guests (customer service) and bringing her personal issues to work. Yes I'm new in this position but a sociologist and work in admin and non profit organizations. This is a very EASY job. 

Today there was a common issue and she came to resolve it at a location, but made it bigger than necessary. She physically directed me to my computer while she was freaking out on the phone and then poked me like a fkn dog twice. I finally spoke up and said, ""I do great with verbal corrections/ criticism, and you absolutely do not have the right to put hands on anyone."" She tried to justify it with the lack of space in the office, but I've trained in bars where things are hectic and we don't treat people like that. She constantly overreacts in front of customers and multiple coworkers have said, it's normal for her to act out when she's stressed. 

Do you guys think I have anything to worry about, should i find a representative? I told her I respected her and that I deserve the same, that no other managers act the way she has in higher levels of stress. The issues were so minute, I'm baffled with her reaction. What would typically happen to someone for physical harrassment, those that work in hr?"

I said I could do it but then accidentally slipped when taking a walk outside so I told him 'nevermind, I can't'. I went to the ER to make sure I was all good (luckily I was). He was still being an asshole at this time over Slack so I just didn't respond to him for the next three days. 

By this time I had made up my mind that I wanted to quit but I wanted to squeeze more hours in. This job was remote so what I would do is just login and do a couple hours of work. He wanted to fire me on Wednesday (he was trying to set up a call with me) but I told him that I didn't want to call with him because of his harassment on calls and over Slack. I kept pushing off the call and ended up getting an extra week of pay. 

It was very satisfying leaving that sweatshop and seeing him grow more frustrated and frustrated the more I ignored his calls. Another person on our engineering team quit recently as well and this boss still can't figure out that he's the problem. Fucking lol."

I have a flex schedule of 10 to 6 so I have to clock in and out with her (others also have a flex schedule, but aren't required to do this). I have a hard-won medical accommodation for the flex schedule and I don't think she's too happy about it.

It's a university so in the summer it's dead; no students or faculty are around. I was 5 minutes late a few times and got a talking to. Really important that I get to my desk by 10 to sit there and see no one all day and answer emails (they don't believe in remote work at this university). I have a long commute and then have to park a 20 minute walk away from my building, which is brutal in the heatwave mt area is going through, so I'm at the mercy of the campus shuttle.

Anyway, when my grandboss/her boss is out, she rolls in at noon and leaves about 5:45. He's traveling this week. Today she arrived around 12:30 and came into my office before she left and said I could leave a little early. Gee golly gosh, those extra 10 minutes will really help my hour long commute. She lives 5 minutes away. It's a very wealthy town I can't afford to live any closer to. 

Don't even get me started on grandboss, who's a faculty member. He treats the staff like trash. We have to get permission from our manager to email him about anything. He told her to tell us we annoy him.

Yes, I'm looking for a new job."

In 20 years I’ve had 3 toxic managers. I work in tech, big surprise there right ?

The most recent manager is truly a lug. An MBA but knows nothing- especially of tech, people, grammar or even how to write a cohesive email or speak properly. 

When he hired me for this $20B company I was told I’d get certs and education reimbursed, but upon trying was told it has to be part of my day to day duties. There are no certs or education programs for a senior “help desk” role who also does sysadmin, networking and infosec duties you moron. Maybe that’s why they call it help desk but pile on whatever else is needed?

Then after learning there are no certs of education programs for me, I apply for the mentorship program. Well guess what? He quietly denied my application, so it never even reached HR, for a free program that could help me.  More and more this guy is toxic and despite being in another state, truly makes me nauseous when I have to speak with him. 

It seems he wants everyone to stay where they’re at- except for his best friend he hired- that dude gets promotions, remote work, training etc. 

The worst is I had a colleague who was scared to take time to address a medical issue that got worse and worse until unbearable and embarrassing at times to be at work with her condition. When asked for remote work ability, despite the fact that we support mostly remote staff, he denied it!

My old boss from about a year ago (we’ve since both gone to separate companies, same field) reached out and offered me a crazy position. Hybrid in the field / WFH position, about 3x what I make currently and seemed like a very good opportunity. I did two phone interviews and things went very well. I had set up a third in person interview and was essentially told the job was mine if I want it. 

Here’s where it gets weird, my old boss called me Tuesday night at 930pm to chat quick. Weird but sure whatever. Well, this was far from a quick chat. This ended up being a 45 minute drunken rant about how difficult and annoying the job is. My old boss proceeded to tell me how unprofessional everyone else was, how the client at the job absolutely hates the company and is about to cancel the contract, the supervisors in place all need to be replaced, and that essentially whoever takes this position is going to be the fall guy for everyone else. In my specific line of work, this is career suicide (would be without a job due to how the contract is set up, your employment is tied to the contract not the company itself). 

So what the fuck? I’ve never had someone call and talk me out of a job before. I’m still going to go through with the third in person interview, but my interest in the position has completely disappeared.

So today I went to work (front desk at clinic), doing my normal task as usual, until my manager wanted to speak with me privately. My manager then told me that they had to terminate me. Based on what they said, the reasons are the following:

1. The environment was too fast paced for me.
2. There were a lot of errors on the appointment scheduling system that were probably caused by me. 

Although they like my positive personality and attitude, they recommended me to work somewhere slower pace. They also told me “This is nothing personal.”  I am sure there is something that I did wrong, but I started this job only two months ago and just got my benefits taken care of this month. I can also clearly say that I always do my best at work, and learning from my mistakes (sorry if I sound defensive). Was this case valid enough to fire me?

You'll need to move to a different department to get more money.""",u/The_Last_Saviour,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e6efxg/we_dont_do_raises_here_youll_need_to_move_to_a/,antiwork,"Having to go through a lengthy and strenuous process of employment verification for a government contract job I am going to start brought back memories from one of the hardest times in my life.

Around 9 ago I used to be a Consumer Support Technician at an antivirus company that primarily marketed on the Home Shopping Network, i.e. aimed at older/retired people with some expendable income. All I did was answer phone calls for technical issues with the program, assist people installing it, and run triage on cleaning their system if they got a virus. I also had to deal with scared people getting the fake ""You have a virus! Call Microsoft at this number!"" pop-ups in Edge, back when Edge came out and had no pop-up controls.

There were only around 8 of us on the Consumer side, about the same number on the Business side, and around 200 other people in the company. We had, I think, around 10,000+ users. And only 16 total people to handle tech support issues. I got good at that job. I was able to determine issues and resolve them quickly, or send them to our developers if it was some program failure. I helped calm people down when they thought they were hacked. I was even on a few three-way calls with users and the scummy ""Microsoft Tech Support"" people, telling the caller this ""Tech"" is a scammer and making the scammer rage. I would train new hires on the product and make sure they could handle it all themselves. I averaged around 40+ calls a day. I kept my call times low while still maintaining quality service. I ended up taking around 10,000 calls in a year. The customers were happy, my manager was happy, and upper management was happy.

I was only making $12/hour. I chose the cheapest option for medical insurance, and declined vision and dental. I would often clock in early to get some extra OT pay. The call queue closed at 9PM, but any calls still in the queue after 9PM had to be cleared out, so we often worked later to handle that. I was lucky if I got $800 on my paycheck. Every month was a very delicate balancing game of making sure I had enough money for rent and utilities, as well as food and litter for my cat. Food for myself came dead last. I considered it a good month if I had $50 left to buy food with. Work did provide free snacks in the break room, things like packets of cup-a-soup, cereal bars, etc. I would always leave work with some in my pocket. When food was catered in for the sales team and people asked if others would like to take the leftovers home, I was always first to respond. There were times when my dinner was spoonfuls of peanut butter. If I was lucky enough to have some extra money, I'd buy tortillas and put peanut butter on that. I'm 5'7"" and I was only 100 pounds back then.

When my yearly performance review came around my manager told me I was doing an absolutely stellar job. My performance was out of the park, call times were low and customers were generally happy. My ability to diagnose issues quickly and effectively was praised. I got ""Exceeds Expectations"" on almost everything. When I asked about pay raises, he dropped that bomb: ""We don't do raises here. You'll need to move to a different department to get more money."" He said this with a straight face. My rent was going up, like rent does every year, and $12/hour was going to not be enough anymore. He gets paid more than me to watch sport videos on his computer and barely do any work, and he's telling me, someone who actually works harder than he does, that I won't be getting a raise.

I found out about a week later that everyone else in the company got raises, except for all of the technical support staff. I couldn't just stop working because I didn't want to be homeless, but I did stop putting in effort. I wasn't as quick on calls anymore. I stopped with my friendly customer service voice and just used a neutral tone that has been described by my girlfriend as ""the verbal equivalent of resting bitch face."" I no longer trained new people. I started shit talking in our department chat shared with the business techs and the developers. They couldn't fire me because I still did a good job and they couldn't afford to let the call queues reach disastrous levels. And they knew that I knew. I stole more snacks from the break room to offset the cost of food I was giving up as rent was going up, because they could at least afford to replace them, even if they couldn't afford to give me a raise. Every time someone wanted to speak to a manager or supervisor I didn't even try to de-escalate the situation, I would just tell my manager there's an unhappy customer that wants to speak with him. Maybe you should do your fucking job now instead of watching sports videos, David.

Around that time one of the people I previously trained and helped out left. He was a cool dude who would still come to me for advice and information after getting good at the job. After almost a year of continuous job searching and suffering at this job, he reached out to me to ask if I was interested in working at a Medicare and Medicaid company he was at. He was moving to a new department and recommended me as his replacement. I jumped on his offer. They were impressed with all of the things I had done at my antivirus job. They wanted to hire me at the end of the interview. I was hoping to make $15 or $16/hour. They offered me $20/hour. The next day I gave my manager 1 week's notice.

During my exit interview with HR, I told them all about how us techs didn't get raises, despite all the work we did. I pointed out my previous review and all of the numbers to back it up and thought no raise was insulting. The HR lady seemed very surprised that we were told this. She asked about me staying there and I flat out said no. Not for that little pay. She asked about my new job and I only told her my new pay, stating clearly that they did offer yearly raises, and options to move up in the company.

I was able to get my old team lead a job in the same team at my new company, and he told me that after I left the call queues went from manageable to ""Oh god, everyone and everything is on fire!"" They had to hire 3 people to replace me because of the amount of calls I was taking, and 1 of them up and quit a few months in. They apparently had money to hire people, but I guess raises were too much. I left the Medicare job after nearly 5 years for the one I'm currently at, and I'm about to start a new job as a System Administrator for an aerospace company near me making $40/hour, so I've come a long way from struggling to live at $12/hour.

I feel like I lost something working at that job that I haven't gotten back. It really colored my attitude when it came to working.

Points to clarify as they didn't really fit well into my story:

I would sometimes hit up the local food pantry when I could. I couldn't get much, but that place definitely helped and I'm eternally grateful to places like it. I donate food to them when I can because I know that struggle.

I had food stamps, but it was only $30/month. It really helped when rent went up.

I didn't get money from relatives, because it wasn't something I was comfortable asking for. I was able to make rent and pay bills, I just couldn't afford much food, let alone anything extra. My relatives did, however, give me food when they could. It wasn't a lot, but a couple cans of soup or vegetables and some fresh grapes where life savers. My mother brought me a whole roasted chicken from Publix once and my cat and I ate like kings for a few days.

I ate so much ramen that I couldn't even smell it without getting violently ill until recently. Same thing with peanut butter.

I couldn't afford to move because my apartment was already my cheapest option, and I definitely couldn't afford an application fee, admin fee, and first month's rent for a new place. Nor could I move in with family, or have someone I don't trust move in with me."

**TL;DR** 
I am sad that I'm on a PIP, simply because of things I would like to work on, which I talked about before being onboarded.

I'm in a bit of a predicament. I was fired from my last job a few months ago - it was an incredibly toxic place, but the reason was completely my fault and I accepted my dismissal without issue. 

I recentl interviewed for a great position, but I froze up when they asked why I left my previous employment and told them that it was incredibly toxic and no longer a good fit for me. 

I have since received a conditional offer based on satisfactory references, along with a request for a background check. The background check outright asks if I've ever been dismissed from a previous job.

I'm stuck on what to answer - I can be honest, and hope for the best. Or I can lie, and hope for the best. I'm not sure option's better.

If anyone has any advice, or been in a similar position, I would really love to hear it. "

I have a new job and I start on Tuesday next week and will be making more an hour plus have access to benefits my old job did not have.  Ya'll were right.  The hiring manager was disgusted when I told her why I was let go from my prior position.  

I'm still waiting to hear back from an even better job with the State and if I get it will have to respectfully decline this position I was hired for -pending background check that will come back clear-,  but for right now I'm happy that I'll have steady employment again.   

No, I did not go to any news outlets and make a stink about it.  I don't care for the spotlight.  I'm actually quite excited for the new job as I'd be firmly a background character instead of playing a main role (provided no emergencies occur.)

Is there another way?,u/Odd_Parking_6286,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e6g6wo/i_chose_the_wrong_career_path_and_now_my_worth_is/,antiwork,"I grew up in a family where people mainly worked healthcare, schools, admin, and civilian / govt jobs , so I really had no knowledge of business/corporate-type jobs until I studied it in college, and even then it was very high level view of the real world. 

I did well in school, even though I didn't enjoy it, and said yes to any opportunity that came my way to get experience. I had no idea what I was doing and just tried my best. I worked sales (not at all for me) then moved into various marketing and related roles because I hoped it would be more creative/enjoyable (I was very wrong). I've worked at start-ups to large corporate companies and always feel like the odd one out on the team. 

I didn't understand why I was being asked to set goals (esp. personal ones) or why my worth was being determined with numbers if I did or did not hit them. Every single meeting is about convincing every employee they need to hit numbers, why the numbers are what they are, how they will increase them to all just create more money for the company and executives.

My experience that my family and peers have with work is not like this (unless a large company buys them out, which was their worst nightmare). You showed up, you did your work tasks, and you went home. No one was constantly judging you as long as you had a good attitude and work ethic.

It seems I've ended up on the entirely wrong job path because not only have I never enjoyed any of my work (although I pretend to with my peers) but these jobs and companies don't utilize my strengths or way of working at all and it's sucking the life out of me physically and mentally after years of being in it. I was told going into business would be a ""smart"" idea even though I wanted to pursue a creative path in the arts and want to spend my time helping people.

I've tried to fulfill this calling outside of my job with different volunteer opportunities and activities, but it's not the same and I really want to dedicate my time to something that matters. I'm also willing to take a big pay cut if it means having something that better aligns with my values.

Has anyone else had a similar experience and changed paths drastically after years of the same career? How do you do it?

Anybody happy in life? It feels like whatever someone makes a goal they almost always fall short. I just wanted an engineering job, to be able to make a living off one job. I went to school and found out my last semester that my degree wasn't accredited, I went to work a trade to take advantage of tuition reimbursement to get back on track then got laid off. I did warehouse work for a while (forklift driver) but left because apparently a lot of people still in the streets look for that type of work, had to duck from gun shots one night during lunch

I went back to my trade job hoping it would be better this time only to find out the craftsmanship has gone to shit because they keep hiring kids straight out of high-school that never used a tool before (had to show somebody how to use a regular ass box wrench). On top of that the union is screwing people over pretty bad. I got a tech position hoping it would lead to an engineering position, but ended up with a manipulative control freak of a manager that would only allow me to go back to school for the degree he chose and college. 

So now I'm right back at my trades position filling out applications almost daily only to be told I don't have enough experience or just ghosted. And I can definitely see myself getting fired from here, my Forman is cool but it's way to many people here that like to pretend they're the boss and try to mouth off at people barking orders.

She asked me if I had any feedback. I replied that the role should be listed as Content Moderation from the start, and that tacking on ""account support"" duties so that they could bury the real work under a CSR title is deliberately misleading.

Not once in these two months has anyone given me proper feedback, everything has been “great” but suddenly in this review he “had a Quick Look” and there were”issues” ( things that could have easily been adjusted in a round of feedback) so that pushed my score down. I then ask for clarification on these points and some of the things he told me I did wrong.. I didn’t even do them! Literally done by coworkers but now I have to fix them anyway! And still have a shit rating in my probation review regardless. I am so absolutely demotivated. I have worked my ass off and get this for it. With expectations to do more and better and speak up more and this and that. So much stress for what. I have no idea how to do this for another 30 or so years. I just want a none corporate job where i don’t deal with people but I can’t switch cause I can’t take the dent in salary. I am just tired. "

Hi! Would love some career advice on how to make this marketing team work!

Background: I work for a large national dealership group. I am over 5 stores in a marketing capacity, with only a new Marketing Director over me. I work in a different part of the country than the new Marketing Director.

So, to summarize, we got a new Marketing Director - he does not communicate AT ALL on any plans, projects, goals or anything he is working on. I was very excited to dive into our new initiatives and work as a team. A big example is about 20 new websites - he said it would be a team effort, but everything is done in the shadows and he does not share timelines or plan deviations, or even short term goals, about this or ANYTHING. I have heard from higher-ups he is working on SO many things that our team has no idea about. I am getting to the point where I'm starting to believe he does not share these projects so that, when something good happens, he will get all the glory. His communication style sucks, and we all believe (not disparagingly) that he is on the spectrum. Managing and communicating are very well impossible for him - his past work places and contacts who know him have also confirmed all of the above. Brilliant - not a team worker, can’t communicate his way out of a paper bag. 

Everyone has been going to the head of the company that he doesn't make sense, he doesn't tell anyone anything, his communication sucks, etc. etc. The head of the company is listening, but he's at a loss for what to do. This guy is extremely smart and knows a lot, but my upward trajectory in this job has seemingly stopped.

What I need advice on: The head of the company asked me to think about what we could do to make the team work. I don't know a team structure where this guy is not over me, but I can still defer to him for expert advice, because I do really value his input. It's also a big issue that when I DO get him involved, he takes whatever it is over and no longer includes me. He has many conversations with my GMs without me knowing anything about it.

The head of the company thought of ""project boards"" to force him to have open communication because he can't force this guy to communicate with the team. I feel it is a bit juvenile to bring out working style down to his level, but I am not 100% opposed to not doing this - but if the issue is with him and his communication with the 3 of us under him (who work together well and never had an issue prior to him taking over our team) why would we need to? 

Anyone have any ideas on how or what I could pitch? I would like to ideally be the manager under him of my region and have managers over the other regions, but I don't know if that is appropriate to pitch as of this moment.
  
I LOVED my job before this guy came in. It's began to get EXTREMELY frustrating and I've thought about rage-quitting more than a few times. Desperate for advice!"

 I am already thinking about looking for another job while i’m working here, but the job outlook in houston SUCKS. I’m also trying to justify staying there bc it’s less than 2 miles from my house, it’s a fairly easy job, and i get free food and unlimited (i think?) free drinks. 
Idk if i should be grateful for what i have given the perks and how convenient it is. On the other hand, it is deceiving the customers because they do not know that they are tipping the owners. in addition, when i worked in a boba shop i made 8-10 an hour my whole time there, and i still got both my cash and card tips.
i know im gonna look for another job. but should i say anything to the owner? like “hey i worked here before and it’s supposed to be like that, you are doing something illegal”.

The problem is: she expects me to deliver in the same rate as a whole team. I've been doing a pretty complex screen, and she is unsatisfied with my performance.

The project has a certain complexity, which makes it difficult to just one person handle it all. Sometimes the client will add a requirement out of nowhere, but management does not really do something about it.

She asks me for a deadline, and when I give her a realistic one, she says it's too much time...

Cut to today-
I’m pulled off the shop floor at the end of the shift today, plant supervisor is there along with my other supervisors.
They decided to “revisit” my review and decided they actually made a “mistake” in giving me a good review- and they absolutely tore me apart, gave me a long list of things I am terrible at, they questioned if I was suitable for my position.

Please note, I have never been told I’m doing anything other than a good job- this was completely out of left field for me. 

So I was put on a 6 month personal improvement plan & if my bosses don’t like my progress they are gonna demote me.

She did say ""My Nameeeeeeeeeeeee, I love my new water bottle"", last week randomly via a IM chat at work. I dunno if she's interested or what. "

I struggled all day with a rusted on fan motor, and didn't get anything else done that day.  I even paid $60 for a puller tool to get the fan blade off, and then another $35 for wrenches that were big enough to operate the puller.  A severe thunderstorm hit while I was in the middle of it, soaking me to the bone.  I told the boss I didn't feel safe working in the lightning.  I told him some mild rain is fine, but rain coming down so hard I can't see what I'm doing, combined with 240v of electricity, combined with lightning, I didn't feel safe and was going to continue to work on it the next day.  He told me that if I can't get any work done, he can't use me.  I returned all the company property to the shop.  No one was there.  I left broken hearted and suicidal.  I said that I will always remember this day as the day that I got my ass kicked, and got fired because of it.  He replied ""I didn't fire you.""

This was on July 2nd.  I have asked several times now about if I'm not fired, then what work do you have for me?  No reply.  A couple of days ago I applied for unemployment.  Got denied before I could even talk to anyone and explain what happened.  They won't even answer the phone.  When I call, I'm required to put in my SSN.  I get a prerecorded message saying essentially, ""we are too busy to take your call.  We aren't going to talk to you."" And then the line disconnects.  I can't get a single solitary god damn answer anywhere.  I called an employment lawyer, and they said that they would do a free consultation and forward my info to one of the attorneys and they would get back to me.  I've called their office and they can't figure out what's going on, so I emailed the guy I talked to but I can't get a response.  My electricity gets shut off on the 23rd, and I'm going to be homeless on the 5th.  All because my boss is too chicken shit to actually fire me, because he knows he is in the wrong.

On top of this, he commanded me to do things that could cause me to lose my HVAC epa license.  I told him what he is asking me to do is illegal, and that we should do it properly.  I've had this conversation several times over text.  Almost all of our conversations were over text.  

On top of things, he is a former inmate, and I'm a former corrections officer.  I can't prove it, but there definitely could be some bias there as well.

I live in Kansas, in the United States. 

The unemployment website kept erroring out every time I tried to add work history.  I truly think Kansas unemployment has been completely gutted, and there actually isn't an unemployment office or anything.  Joys of living in a Red state ♥️.  

I feel so  unbelievably hurt, angry, betrayed, and blindsided.  

I feel like I have no out in my corner.

And people wonder why men have a higher suicide rate than women 

In my interview I was promised:
30+ hours a week
And a $3/hour raise after 2 weeks

I have only had about 3 weeks that were 30 or more hours.  Most of my first few paychecks were 20 hours for 2 weeks.

I'm a grown man with a disabled wife (however she hasn't been able to get disability yet).

I dont have kids, but that doesn't mean that my wife and I don't deserve to be able to support ourselves.  

I fucking hate this country so bad.  It is so ready to turn a blind eye to bullshit and say, ""it's not my problem.""

It's only getting worse too, as each family is struggling harder and harder.  People can't help others as much as they used to.  

I feel so unfairly treated.  

And between me and my boss, only one of us is going to end up homeless at the end of the month.  And of course it's the person that wanted to do things right, and didn't want to die by electrocution in the line of duty.  

Just ranting, but if anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it."

I didn't know how to help, so I just left it (which was the correct decision). Most people on our team work an early shift, and this was later in the day, so they were gone by that point. The only person who was able to help wasn't responding, so after about 20 minutes this coworker sent me a private message asking if I knew how to do it. Me, knowing fully well I don't know what to do but feeling like I'm stuck in a corner, told them that I'll respond in the group chat so that others can see (which was a huge, major mistake, I should've just kept it as a private conversation).

I gave them an answer that basically said we should leave this for others so we don't mess anything up, but apparently the language I used made it sound like I was telling them that it didn't matter and we should neglect it completely; this is because my manager's manager is in this group chat, saw the message, and responded to me with an offended tone.

It kind of shocked me for a bit since I didn't really think I said anything crazy but it was bad enough to the point where the person who knew what to do responded within seconds after that telling me the correct way to go about solving this.

It was really awkward after that. I don't know if I'll get in trouble once my manager sees the messages, but it was quite the experience. This incident also kind of soured my view of everyone involved. The manager's manager for obvious reasons, the person who knew how to solve the issue for not responding until everything boiled over, and the coworker who asked the question and for some reason decided to private message me instead of the person who actually knew how to solve the issue. 

To be honest, I'm not going to go out of my way to help that coworker anymore. They are the weak link in the team, and they consistently drag me down. I've gotten in trouble on a few occasions for something they did or didn't do, and because I'm regularly paired with them in certain tasks because we work similar hours, I am admonished almgside them even if I did everything I was supposed to do correctly.

So what lesson did I ultimately learn? It's to keep a low profile at your job, do the bare minimum, don't go out of your way to help people who will drag you down, and just do your work in as much silence as possible because everything you say and do WILL be used against you."

During highschool I wanted to be the little engineer that could, I took engineering classes, took advanced math at a young age, and even did internships. One of two internships I did (they lasted about three to six months each) involved me helping write code to help send a satellite the company owned into orbit (honestly, my superior at the time would have the code written already and I just kinda had to 'figure out' the very small portion that was left to solve, but not really solve). The second internship was helping make harnesses for a rocket that was suppose to launch(the internship finished before they finished the project so idk what happened to both the rocket and the satellite)

After the internships I decided STEM was not really for me so I decided to become an English teacher because my parents are immigrants and learned English and I thought it was really cool to teach people how to speak a new language. I ended up getting my degree and after college I worked via zoom for a Chinese company teaching individuals from China how to speak English for just one semester. When the semester ended they offered me a permanent position which would have involved me moving to china (I would have taken it but the wages were really bad) so I've been unemployed since June or around there. 

I've been trying to apply to accounts revivable clerk, and even receptionist positions but I cannot get hired no matter what I do. I would think my experience would be decent? I'm 22 btw if that matters. Anyways I cannot seem to get an office job to save my life and I'm absolutely losing my mind. I honestly think I have gotten rejected by over 100 jobs for entry level position for accounts payable, data entry, office secretary, you name it. Now when I get rejected I just say ""qualified enough to send a satellite into orbit, not qualified enough to use an Excel spreadsheet"" (I know I didn't technically send the satellite into orbit, but it's just a saying 😩) 

Keep in mind between the internships and the teaching job I used to work at a restaurant where I did payroll for like a year and a half, idk I'm drunk.I ALREADY KNOW THE BASIS OF THAT DAMN THING, yet I'm still not qualified enough for an entry level office job. I've also gotten rejected to be A FUCKEN SECURITY GUARD, FML.

The posting was for a full time faculty position, an adjunct applied, and then they offered him a leadership position for Department Chair that I was actively in training for.

I'm very frustrated by this. My supervisor has had me in training to become the Department Chair, and I have been a full time Assistant Professor for 8 years. They gave the Department Chair position to an adjunct who was applying for a completely unrelated position.

I work as a dog trainer, I work both at a facility and independently. A bit of background; I’ve been in this for nearly a decade at this point, I’ve successfully trained and placed four service dogs in the last few years, I also help people who already own the dog train it for service work. I do a multitude of other training as well such as behavior modification, sports foundations, basic and advanced obedience, etc.

My coworker at the facility recently got a new certification and believes she’s god’s gift to dog training. She’s currently taking on any client she can get her sticky nasty little hands on, including service dog clients.

Here’s where the problem comes in; if you don’t know exactly how to train a seizure, cardiac, diabetic, migraine, etc alert, someone is fucking DEAD. And she doesn’t understand that. She doesn’t CARE. The boss also doesn’t CARE.

I’ve begun ignoring the “non-compete” and stealing every single service dog client straight out from under her. Because she’s going to result in serious injury or fucking DEATH. She’s training odor off of clothing!! The dog could be freaking alerting to the detergent brand for all you know????

Anyway, I’m absolutely furious that no one really seems to give a shit because these clients are disabled and apparently everyone at that facility is violently ableist smh.


TLDR: Coworker is taking on clients she shouldn’t be and it could result in serious injury or death."

Am I in the wrong?,u/Ok_Blueberry2904,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e75yeo/got_hurt_at_work_and_employer_is_trying_to_fight/,antiwork,"A month ago, at work, I was wearing my ppe and while i was walking one of my shoe laces of my steel toe boots got hung up in the hook of the other shoe causing me to trip and fall over on my knees. Both of my knees were bruised and hurt for a couple weeks but seemed to get better at first. Now exactly 4 weeks after the incident it starts hurting again and it seems to be getting worse with every step I take. It almost feels dislocated in some kind of way.

Anyways, at that time I immediately reported the incident to HR and requested an incident report. Since I know how our HR, I took a picture of the notes she made but I don't think she ever actually wrote the incident report. I never saw it or signed it. However, I have the picture of her notes, the pictures of my knees at the time from different days after the incident and I was able to get a hold of the camera footage of the actual incident. 
Since the pain is getting worse I explained to HR that I will try to rest over the weekend and wait until Monday to see if the pain is better or not, then decide if I want to be seen by a doctor. HR is now telling me that they will check with the insurance to see if this is even considered a workers comp case. I have a feeling they'll try to fight this. 
I don't want to wait for their answer and like to be prepared ahead of time, but now I'm questioning, am I in the wrong and this is not a workers comp case? Does it vary by state? Or will any lawyer have a field trip fighting this case?"

5,2024-07-19,Worked 9.5 hours without a lunch break or rest breaks ,u/Inevitable_solace,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e76q9j/worked_95_hours_without_a_lunch_break_or_rest/,antiwork,"Some background: I work at a board and care facility for the elderly with psychiatrist diagnoses. Most of the residents I work with are schizophrenic, have dementia, or a traumatic brain injury that leaves them unable to take care of themselves. I am an appointment coordinator and my job is to manage their medical health by scheduling and taking them to all of their medical appointments, as well as advocating for them during those appointments and making sure all their needs get covered. Most of the residents aren’t able to articulate what their health issues are and can hardly understand why they’re at doctor appointments half the time, so it’s very important for me to be there to make sure everything goes smoothly and report the progress and outcome of each appt back to our staff at our facility. 

Yesterday I had to take a resident to the ER because his blood work showed he was positive for MRSA. My managers stopped me in the middle of getting ready for a diff appt and told me I had to take the MRSA resident asap since MRSA is a pretty serious infection, so I did just that. We left around 11:40AM, and I was there until 6PM. Throughout this whole time I never received a lunch break or rest breaks. My manager never even bothered to check on me to ask if I needed someone to come cover me so I could go on my lunch. I wasn’t able to leave my resident on his own because he is high needs and needs to be supervised at all times while out in the community. I clocked in to work at 8:30AM and didn’t get off till 6:15PM (usually I’m off at 5:00PM) and went the whole 9.5 hours without food or a break. I am so incredibly upset by this. 

My manager(s) knew I was there. They kept asking how the resident was doing, but not once mentioned sending someone to cover me. The reason I didn’t say anything sooner about needing someone to cover me is because in the past when I’ve gone to the ER with a resident and have asked for someone to come replace me, I’ve been told that no one was available to take my spot, so I’ve been forced to stay overtime until the resident either gets admitted into the hospital or discharged from the ER. 

It wasn’t until 4:30PM, half an hour before I was suppose to be off, that I texted my manager asking for someone to replace me bc I hadn’t had a lunch break all day. He responded ten min later saying “so sorry. Someone is gonna go replace you.” That person didn’t get there till a whole hour later. (Not blaming them btw). I could’ve said something earlier, but I wanted to see how long my manager would go without offering me a lunch, and it seems he never would’ve said anything if I hadn’t spoken up myself. I think that’s incredibly unprofessional and insincere. How can you willingly and knowingly leave your employee without food or a break for 9.5 hours straight? I have a degree in cognitive science, live in California, and make $19/hr—not nearly enough to deal with this bs. It’s not the first time something like this happens which makes it even more infuriating. 

Needless to say, I’ve put in my two weeks. "
2,2024-07-19,I got screwed over with PTO,u/gingygingy-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e76sms/i_got_screwed_over_with_pto/,antiwork,"Posted this in r/jobs but wanted to post here too

I started working at my current company about six months ago. The company allots 10 days of accrued PTO for new hires. Before I accepted the offer, I had a very clear conversation via email (so I have this conversation in writing) saying that I had two trips in the summertime that were already planned and paid for, so I would need to take 14 days of PTO total for those trips. The recruiter explicitly stated that they would be okay with me taking those days off, and that even though my PTO balance will show as negative in our onboarding/HR system, it will be fine because we agreed to this before I got hired. The balance will reset to 0 at the beginning of next year. I have already gone on one trip (4 days of PTO), so I am already in the negatives. But to my understanding, this should all be fine.

I leave for a trip next week where I will be taking 10 days of PTO. My supervisor approved it forever ago. Everything was fine until I was informed by my boss that I would be “too far” in the hole and will need to take some of my trip as unpaid. I told him that I was told that I could use those days for PTO when I got hired on, and that the recruiter and I came to a mutual agreement on that before so I accepted  the job offer. He apologized for any misunderstanding that may have occurred in the hiring process, but was still firm on not using PTO for my some of my trip. I asked specifically how many days he would recommend taking as unpaid, and he said 7 out of the 10 days as unpaid. That means I’d only be getting paid for 3 days of my trip.

This is bullshit, right? I was promised 14 days for my two trips, and even when I sent him proof of the email where I was told I could have those days off, he is ignoring my side of the story. I’m not going to fight it since we don’t have an HR department (and I’m trying to find a new job right now anyway), but I am definitely pissed. I even contacted the recruiter and told him about my situation. He told me in person he received the email but neglected to actually respond to it. Advice? Thoughts?"

There was no mention of travel anywhere in the listing when I applied or in the interviews.

  
It's 100% remote, the salary is fantastic, and it's not that stressful at all. It really is a golden job. 

They fired my old boss about 2 months ago and now I have a new one and she wants me to travel. It wouldn't be often, but I really cannot/do not want to for various reasons. And this was never mentioned any time during the application process. 

I'm in the US and employment is at-will here, so if I decline I feel like I would get fired. But I do want to keep the job (they would very likely hire me full-time after the 2 years is over). Is this hill worth getting fired for? 

I guess I should mention a few reasons I do not want to travel (please no judgement):

1. Airport is 1 hour away and parents would need to take time off their inflexible jobs to drive me there/back.

2. I suffer from severe anxiety.

3. I also have a severe fear of flying.

4. Because of my anxiety I have developed an irregular heartrate which makes me pass out from time to time.

5. I have low blood pressure and have passed out from this as well in the past. I also get migraines frequently.

6. I have horrible experiences with Ubers and do not feel comfortable Ubering anymore (I would have to for travel).

7. I have insomnia that is exacerbated when in hotels, so basically I wouldn't sleep at all.

It also states clock in after 5 minutes would be considered tardy. They are threatening to terminate me for clocking in before the 5 minute point. Funny thing is im still there 10-15 minutes before my manager and also stay later then him. If they do go through with termination would u have any ammo for a lawsuit. I will probably talk to attorney but wondering if it is a waste of time.

2,2024-07-19,Is Victorian Era Micro-Management a thing in your Companies?,u/LesserValkyrie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e78kl0/is_victorian_era_micromanagement_a_thing_in_your/,antiwork,"Heya!

I had a long fuss last week about yeah phone at work. I will make a long VENT text, you can read or just read the tl;dr and give your opinion on this.

**Tl;dr** : *Does you company have ""micro-management"" politics like no phone at work / restraining people to go to pee / things like that?*

*Because I have my opinion on this subject, I will write it down just there with personal trivias, but I really want to know if it is me that is crazy, or if it is a standard to have what I call ""Victorian Era Micro-Management Rules that are made by people who try to have control on whatever they can because they lost control on their own life"".*

*(Yeah I have a... anarchist mindset about it).*

When I was an apprentice my N+1 always told me ""I know you, I know you work well, but yeah don't be seen on your phone because it's badly seen in companies"" and I was like :

""Who cares as long as the job is done?""

""Do people really have time to check on me?""

Answers were :

""Everybody, some people only goals in life are micro-management even if it is not their responsability because it gives them an illusion of a control they don't have in their life anymore""

and

""No, but they will do whatever they can do find some to do exactly this instead of doing actual work.""

Turns out it was a really good advice and actually the whole key to be well seen in a company is pretending you are working as a perfect employee according to Hollywood movies standards, even if it implies sacrifying... quality of actual work. This is what I understood even if I had the theory all set after 10-15 years in my career.

I got promoted to a Team Lead last year and I am doing well for now, the hierarchy is happy about my work and I'm thriving doing this. I don't have any management background (except Leutnant in the army but... yeah army management is not quite the same as the company ones lol) but I took a lot of courses, read a lot, and always found great personal acheivement to find ways to make a team productive while being happy because I've read somewhere that being happy / having a good quality of life at work increases producitivty.

Hopefully, in all companies I were in, conditions were set so I could be on my phone when I had nothing else to do, take longer coffee breaks as long as my job was being done, and go the toilets, go to drink, whenever I wanted because it is a basic need and unless you are a kid locked up in the closet by abusive sociopathic parents, nobody can prevent you to fullfill these needs in a developed country.

And really I always found it normal. This is why I said to my team : ""Yeah, I don't care at all about what you are doing in your days as long as your job is done and you do what is necessary to not give more job to the others"".

It is my limit, the only one that is interesting. If someone doesn't do his job, not good. If someone does the minimum but doesn't use his remaining time to take care of the shared responsabilities of the team and other teammates have to do it while he could have done it more easily because he had more time, yeah, not good neither. Things like that. But if there is nothing else to do or if they want to send messages during the infernal amount of loading times our softwares have or stuff, yeah go for it.

If they are on their phone 60% of one day because there was stricly nothing else to do, then it's my fault to not giving them enough work (these days happen and you can't do anything about it, work comes by waves depending on the period, sometimes you have to work a lot, and sometimes you are updated in every possible subject ever and not everyone have projects to work on so they have nothing to do). Not their faults. It would be cruel to force them to stare at the wall when there is nothing else to do, tbh they can go outside have a coffee it won't change the productivity of the day. I made the calculations.

Except that if they stared at the whole for 4 hours the next day they will be angrier to come to work, so nobody will be happy with that.

My team is responsible enough to do its job, I see it on the KPI, nobody from my team complains that some people don't work in my team and it looks fine, the results are given on time. If it changes because someone decides to go to the toilets 6 hours a day, yeah I WILL FORBID EVEREYONE TO GO TO THE TOILETS DURING DAY. No ofc not I'll just discuss with him and see what are our solutions. But it most likely won't happen, because we are adults professionnals. (I hope so).

OK to come up about what this thread was about,  during a weekly team lead stand-up/meeting, another Team Lead reported to me that ""yeah my team reported to me that they often see your team on their phone"".

We don't have at all the same work to do but we share the same work space. Yet they report their Team Lead about what my team does? WHY?  Do they really have time for that? Will it increase their own productivity? Why? Yet another mystery to solve for me.

I've waited all my life for this situation but never really came up with a huh DEI answer. Otherwise I'd be like ""who do they think you are, the GESTAPO, don't they even have a class consciousness anymore?"".

""It is unfair because my team can't use phone so when they see your team using theirs they say it's unfair.""

""Then allow them to use their phones, idk""

""No because they won't work."" (ofc they are 8 yo kids)

""I think that the discipline in your team is none of my concerns. -- and if they think life is so perfect in my team we have 2 open positions rn they can just apply idk""

Then I asked my N+1.

""Is there a company rules about not using phones at work.""

And he tells me no (I mean I knew we searched for it together and asked the HR when I took the position lol).

Anyways it stops quite like that.

Everyone forbids it because it was there when they came in (it was put in place ni the 80s), and nobody questionned it.

But what surprises me the most is that most people think that if you don't forbid phones at work yeah nobody will work and stuff. That if people take 10 minutes to take a dump then the company will go bankrupt, or the shareholders will have to buy a private jet with less options and it will change their lives.

For me it's industrial era foreman's mindset. I'm not paid to watch people's peepee and things like that I have a lot of other responsabilities as a team lead that... monitoring peepee time. So it surprises me to see how important it his in people's mind in 2024.

(And I feel some quite of disgusts to people who don't even have the responsabilities to watch people's peepees in their job descriptions, yet they do it anyways and report whatever they can to management. I have a coworker from the other problematic team who takes note on coffee break times of her team's coworkers and... yeah. It takes a lot of time and energy to do that, she should use it on his own work instead. Expecially when it's known that she does a lot of mistakes, has a hard time finishing her work without help and stuff like that. It's never the best elements who micromanage their coworkers from my experience, this is why I really feel like this ""I have no control in my life anymore and I will make it everybody help's problem"").

So here with my solilloqy.

I wanted to know how your company is doing this and what is your opinion about it, I really want to know opinions from people I don't really used to hang on with, to see where the standards stand and stuff like that.

For those who read, thank you!"

I am attempting to raise awareness of the [Heritage Foundation’s Budget Blueprint Policy Proposals] (https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html), specifically their 17 policy proposals regarding Social Security.  This is the “Project 2025”  plan for Social Security. 

In 2024, Social Security ‘s budget was [$1.12 trillion] (https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/social-security-administration?fy=2024).  The average monthly benefit for someone on Social Security is [$1,907](https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-01903).  Project 2025 intends to cut approximately [$1.076 trillion](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html).  That is over 96.07% of Social Security’s budget.  
 
If you don’t currently receive Social Security, you want this program to continue.  [70.6 million Americans received benefits from programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in 2022](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2023/fast_facts23.html).  This is roughly 21.2% of Americans.  It is likely that your parents, grandparents, and many other loved ones would not be financially independent without Social Security benefits. [Already, many who receive Social Security benefits are struggling and cannot manage their financial situation](https://www.businessinsider.com/social-security-no-savings-snap-benefits-debt-boomers-experiences-2024-6). If Project 2025 reduces the amount of monthly benefits or reduces who is eligible to receive benefits, those people will face poverty, homelessness, food shortages, etc.  
 
Social Security is financed because workers like you [pay into it]( https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/HowAreSocialSecurity.htm).  The program was created so that American workers could retire at a reasonable age or in the event of a disabling injury. Taking it away means many would not have the financial stability to retire, be financially independent in their old age, or would need to provide care to aging relatives. 
## Here's what you can do to stop them:
Ensuring that the Social Security programs continue, that benefits are not reduced, and that claimants and beneficiaries remain eligible are consistently among the most critical issues to voters. 

I am asking for the members of this subreddit to boost awareness of the Heritage Foundation’s intended policy proposals with regard to Social Security in the hopes that the public will take action to prevent their implementation. I feel that this information is extremely important for members of this community in making decisions with regard to their financial, health, employment, and political future.  
 

Simply put, I believe Reddit can affect an enormous impact with posts like [this one](https://x.com/malhdavis/status/1807867524031435221?s=43&t=2BuDBRYaPjNYAtdzvgK8BA), which show screencaptures from the Heritage Foundation's own website as conclusive proof of their intention to cut billions from the Social Security programs. I believe Redditors can post these images across various social networks to raise awareness.  

Social Security is, for many people, their main source of income, what they rely on when they retire, their safety net when they get injured or get sick. Don’t let them take it away without a fight."

If you think you know where I work, no the fuck you don't. 

I am just so fed up with the job, I am so close to rage quitting. I feel like I am constantly set up for failure. I feel like I do not have enough time in between events to get to the next one on time. I feel like I don't have enough time at the shop before or after my events and driving to either properly stock my truck or clean it without one of the owners copping an attitude and bitching about us running up the time clock. I feel like I'm not given the resources I need to succeed. I feel like my boss and manager thinks that they own my time both during the work day and outside of work hours. Just today, 3 hours before my shift starts, I get a message from the group chat saying that the schedule has changed a little bit. My schedule changed to where I would now be staying three extra hours than before. I have plans to see my brother, sister-in-law, and nephew. The manager didn't bother to call and ask anybody to see if they could change their schedule, they just went ahead and did it. And this is not the first time it's happened. My bosses seem to think that this is the best job ever, but they don't pay as high as they should for what they want. They don't offer any sort of benefits, no insurance, no vacation time, they don't even offer direct deposit. The work conditions are difficult, in the summer sun. I also don't feel like the owners value their employees feedback. The rules and expectations are constantly changing. One day the expectation will be one thing I'll come in the next day and it's completely different, and I will hear about the change from another employee, not necessarily a manager or boss. I couldn't tell you how many times I've mentioned not liking them changing my schedule last minute, on account of the fact that I do have a life outside of work and pets I need to care for.

On top of that, we had a crazy busy month in may, where most of the employees were getting 50 to 60 hours a week. Then in June they hired on 5 or 6 different people, now our full-time employees hours have been reduced to about 20. They should have hired on the new guys back in April so that they were fully trained and independently working by May. I'm actively looking for a new job, and I can't wait until I find one.

I filed a claim with DIR last year. This was a recurring problem that started before me and continues today.

* I was hired to work full-time and was expected to be fully available, but only got 1-3 shifts a week the last 6 months I worked there.
* I was trusted to train literally every other event server, but lost the more lucrative events to my trainees. Their events could be worth hundreds of dollars more than mine based on the contract alone.
* My GM told me I was one of his most valuable employees based on my performance, willingness to work events, and for being a competent trainer.
* I tried to pick up open shifts from my coworkers, but each attempt was blocked by a manager without explanation.
* I made the least amount of money of any of my coworkers, again without explanation from management.
* This started after I complained to receive payment for 12 meal period violations.
* I got into regular arguments with management over missing tips, not getting breaks, and making less than my coworkers.

After 6 months of making less than half of my normal income, I left because I was basically broke. My GM told me I might still have a place if I changed my mind. 

The new place was good money and had a great payroll program, but it was a miserable place to work for other reasons. I worked there for 2 months.

I called my old GM after hearing they were swamped with events and he agreed to hire me back. I asked if he would need me to sign any paperwork, but he told me it was unnecessary and I should put in my two weeks at the new job. I put in my notice, trained my replacement, and texted my old GM to ask when he wanted me to start. His response was simply that he changed his mind and I was a bad fit for the job \*he'd already offered me.\*

I filed a retaliation claim against my former employer based on a suggestion from the DIR agent I spoke with. I don't have access to my time cards anymore, but I can prove that my paychecks were off, I frequently missed breaks, my income was impacted, and that my GM's actions screwed me out of two jobs.

What information would I need to make my case? I have a lot of circumstantial evidence, but no idea if it's useful."

7,2024-07-19,About to quit my job. Had enough. ,u/Psycho_pigeon007,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e7ewuq/about_to_quit_my_job_had_enough/,antiwork,"I work at a quick lube shop that prides itself in doing things faster than a jiffy, with the oldest motor oil brand in the country (150+years) so do with that what you will. 

I started working for company mid 2019 in Ohio in a corporate shop location, then moved to Utah to continue my career from the comfort of my home state, in a franchise shop location. I ended up getting put on pip and recovered, only to be fired shortly after pip expired. They fought me like crazy over unemployment, and eventually won. Whatever though, that's in the past. Had another job for a while, until my wife convinced me to move to Texas. Since I couldn't install appliances remotely, I had to quit that job, I miss it though. 

Flash forward to getting a job at same oil shop company back in October 2023. I shouldn't have ignored the signs and red flags, but I legitimately love this work and what it allows me to do with my life and my time. Immediately after being hired, I was handed my employee handbook and told to basically ignore it, and that they just do everything online (which is partly true, but there's a difference between the online university and the book work)
My trainer never went over anything in the book at all ever, to this day none of my higher ups have opened my book to verify my work or progress. 

The only way to get promoted is by having your higher ups follow through and approve your work, as well as getting you certified in each of the three main positions in the shop. They've flat out refused to certify on paper, they just say I'm good to go. Okay whatever 👌 time goes on and I find out that everyone has large problems with/at this shop. There's no leadership presence either. My manager will sit downstairs or in his truck in the lot for HOURS while we've got cars rolling through. Nobody cleans up the shop, and I end up having to take the brunt of the cleaning, because I'm scheduled as the closing bottomside tech and nowhere else. Speaking of schedule, I've had my hours cut dramatically since a couple months ago, starting with getting OT most weeks, to this week where I'm scheduled for 9.5 hours total. Only working one day. To be fair, Part of this was a request to be able to be home more, so we agreed (verbally) that I would have a better schedule for that. Time goes by and they keep cutting hours and I have the option to put my thumb up my ass, or quit. And I don't take anal. 

So can I get a little help here? I'd love to know what I can do to mitigate loss and get what I deserve. 

(Apologies for the slightly disorganized nature of this post, I'm just fuming and am still learning how to stand up for myself employment-wise)"

Late last year i got a new director for my department where my good friend was my manager and had recruited me to join his team and help rebuild the department for the nonprofit we work for. Within the first week of her starting, the new director committed violence against my friend for disagreeing with her professionally and my friend filed a complaint about the incident with HR. Two weeks after that, she and the acting HR director fabricated evidence and framed my friend for a crime to justify terminating him immediately, and then she gave his job to her unqualified friend. A month after this she began a campaign of harassment and intimidation against me and the rest of my friend’s team while forcing the 3 of us to do the entire departments work while her favorites just relaxed and took credit. Multiple complaints of harassment, violence, bullying, and intimidation against have gone nowhere. 1 team member started kissing her ass and stopped getting harassed. The 2nd targeted person resigned a month ago and found a new job, while I’m the last remaining member of the team that’s been getting harassed and targeted. I finally got HR to step up monitoring and I’d gone from being actively harassed to being treated as nonexistent. 

Anyways, a couple days ago HR sent out an internal recruitment notice for the Director’s position. I spoke to my manager yesterday, who’s been just absolutely useless and trying to be nice while enabling the Director, and she confirmed that the Director submitted her resignation and will be moving on. Her last day is next month, and I think I’ll be taking some PTO to skip whatever farewell they plan for her. 

I’m also considering applying for her job since I have about 70% of the MQs, and the outgoing Director publicly admitted a few months ago that she was thoroughly unqualified for the job when she was hired and just winging it."

They agreed but only if I would pay the cost of a stop payment...whatever, I need the money so fine....charge me.

They then didn't contact me for 6 hours while I was at work/on the clock. Instead they waited until I was clocked out (they have access to the online timeclock, they knew) to call me and let me know they had issued a direct deposit. All good???

Then HR, who was leading this call proceeded to chastise me about not being professional in my emails and phone calls for 5 minutes....but like I said, I was off thr clock, and actually at a vets office with my dog so I politely told them I don't have time for this call right now, I'm off work and super busy dealing with my dog let's finish this monday.....

I came out of the vets office to a email notification....I got written up for ""hanging up on HR"" regardless of whether or not I let them acknowledge what I had said before ending the call, it's california...and in california, as far as I know, we are not required to do any work related activities while off the clock, which I clearly was.

I have since had a career change where I am in an office setting that provides community resources to the public on a daily basis. I love my job and the work I do BUT since working there I have encountered tons of ""small unexpected expenses"" that really are starting to get under my skin. It is little things like having to buy a $10.00 t-shirt for an outreach program, investing in gatorade/water/snacks for programs, and buying random gifts for birthdays/holidays. Now I know many are going to say that I am ""choosing"" to buy these things but when your boss comes up to you on Friday and says they are having a employee birthday party that I need to attend the next week, then saying no at that point makes me the bad guy when everyone else will be there. On top of that I really don't want to buy ""stuff"" that I know is going to be consumed or maybe not even wanted by the public/co-workers. At this point it has become an added bill I have to factor into my monthly expenses and it's pissing me off honestly. 



It's hard knowing that saying NO to these things isn't really an option as I would be the only employee who doesn't participate and that is horrible for work morale in a small office. Regardless I was not expecting to have to ""cash out"" at least once a month for some random reason that otherwise I would not choose to do so.

I'm telling you what man, working for someone is getting pretty god damn ridiculous these days. I mean what the fuck do they actually expect? I get up and show initiative and stay busy I get punished with points over the dumbest shit. I sit at my station and JUST do my station all of a sudden they're taking our chairs cause were not doing enough lol. 

I work at a slow ass store. They put me on shifts with kids who don't know how to do shit and don't give a fuck to do it right. So I go do it. I know how to do basically everything within my power there, I got leadership experience so I basically take lead of these kids and all I do is have em do the meat and potatoes of the job. I deal with customers, I fix shit, I stock shit, I do my job and some every god damn day. I show up early every god damn day. I see something needs done I just fucking do it. I prefer to do it cause if I do it it gets done good. With a whole ass. lol

Nd these mother fucker in corporate man, our regional manager is basically a useless fuck who cant get no bitches so he sits on the cameras all day long watching us, probably beating his dick at the thought of giving a point for one of their many redundant ass hoops they been throwing at us anymore. I swear to god I think these people just get bored. I think they sit around a fucking table, and just fuck around all day. This dude is on the camera 12 hours a god damn day just beating the shit outta his dick. Looking like a down-syndrome Bobby Hill. 

Anyways, to just give an example, just a fucking drop out of the bucket of bullshit I've dealt with for the past 7 months now. 

Today I was scheduled with these two kids. I put em in the tunnel and I worked the Kiosks. Usually we work the Kiosks because corporate wants us to sell memberships and help customers figure out what they want to buy and pay for it. We started using these new iPad systems that required us to be there scanning peoples cards with the camera. Well today the IPad system was down so we went back to using the Kiosks. Now when we use these Kiosks nobody REALLY needs to be there for customers to buy stuff and all these things. Your really more of a salesperson/door greeter when the Kiosks are working. ANYWAYS, these two kids are good kids, but they aren't really worth a shit professionally speaking. They arent the type to go looking for shit to do, or go above in any way. 

So as the days going on it gets real slow, So I decided to check the parking lot real fast since I hadn't seen these kids do a restock in a few hours and I wanted to make sure people had stuff they were gonna need out there. There wasn't so I went and grabbed some towels, refilled the bottles, did a quick scan on the trash cans and while I was out there maybe 4 cars came thru and you know since we was on Kiosks today, they was already used to that and didnt really need me at all anyways, I mean not one hang up lol. They pulled up paid their money and went on thru like they woulda did if I were out there. Wasn't no big deal at all, while I was still in the lot, I had two customers who's equipment wasn't working so I took a look and fixed the equipment quickly and it must of only been like 20-25 minutes of me being away from the pay station, Im getting texted by the GM who's being texted by the regional manager who sitting there jacking his dick on the cameras probably in some lonely dingy hotel room getting all hot and bothered cause I walked away to do some shit that needed done. Even if those kids were out there stocking shit, they wouldn't know how to fix the shit like I do they woulda came and got me anyways. I get punished for doing shit they dont do, im not a boss im not gonna go bossing people around at my wage, but I also care bout my job and want the customers happy so I fucking throw that shit on my back and end up getting punished for being the god damn backbone of my store. Its fucking ridiculous. 

You get punished when you do nothing and you get punished when you do something lol, I cannot wait to quit this job man. "

I've been working at a fast food chicken chain for about 2 months. I'm in college so it sounded like good temporary work. I applied for a full time position and a manager mentioned 5-7 hour shifts. The thing is the restaurant gives me hours based on how busy the place is. After the first week, My hours drastically reduced over time. Instead of full time I scrape by with almost 9-12 hours a week. Was making piss money. Sometimes a shift would only be 3 hours. I got called into the office saying it was due to performance but really I have been doing everything what they asked. I admit I work a bit slow but it's so I can claim a few more minutes in my hour less schedule. I work at my own rate. It's not like I just fucked off on my phone or anything (that's what the other employees do) their turn over rate is incredibly high and they seem to just keep highering more teens instead of giving me hours to work.

Yesterday I was fired for the first time ever.

I'd made a mistake and said something that would have been a microtransgression (slightly inappropriate story about growing up Jewish) at work to a coworker and immediately knew it wasn't work appropriate. I apologized then, and then I apologized later.  This was at an after hours getting drinks after a conference. I slipped into being a little too casual once, and learned from the mistake (I've also reduced how much I drink at work events as well and made a positive change in my life.)

I technically violated the code of conduct, but it also mentioned unless this was a major transgression that I would be given a warning or some training. This was not the case and I was fired without any warning yesterday after only finding out I was under investigation 2 days ago. Did I mention this event happened FOUR MONTHS AGO. Another coworker got fired as well for a minor transgression.  It felt like a very extreme reaction to me making an honest mistake a long time ago.

Was given 1 month severance, trying to apply for unemployment, and uncertain how to recover honestly. It's grief plain and simple, but don't even want to go back into the high stress tech shit anymore. It just feels like someone was gunning for me despite being there a year and a half and doing good work and getting kudos. The last thing I did before I was fired was prep for a 1:1 to talk about how to get to a senior role....

Any advice on how to survive this a little more gracefully would be appreciated. I'm currently just trying not to drink more than usual, feeling everything as it comes up and going into it (Buddhist meditation more or less), going outside and biking a ton, and spending time with my wife before her new job starts.

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to move forward now that I've done all the minor adulting tasks of applying for unemployment, cancelling auto drafts for retirement, subscriptions, etc. I could barely even play piano today because I just kept ruminating on the situation.

Is it ok to just take some time to just exist? We've got some savings as well and maybe can survive a year without me bringing much in other than doing some teaching. I've been thinking a lot about the next steps in my life anyhow since being in tech isn't fulfilling at all, and I'm tired of these very very stupid politics.

I was very lucky to find the job just the next day before arriving. (This shit is incredibly hard for an immigrant) Only to find is the worst job I’ve ever had. 

Project manager is the most boomer person I’ve ever met in my life. He prints emails (this should be enough to make yourself an idea about him). 80% of the time I don’t know what I’m doing and I have to figure it out by myself. He doesn’t give any context to the work whatsoever until it’s too late. Then the blame is on me because I’m “too slow”

He keeps asking me to go to the office on Saturdays, makes fun about my shoes, keeps telling me I’m single and I don’t have anything to do with my life besides job. A couple days ago he made fun about having some coca1n3 to speed up my work.  He even asked me one day if my partner is “male or female”. 

One day he told me: “you gotta make the job your #1 priority, everything revolves around it”

It’s been only 4 months and I’m really done with this crap. Now I have twitchy eyes. The happiest day of my life since my arrival was a couple days ago when I had to go to the doctor: I got an eye infection and I had two sick days. 

To make it worse, I should be “grateful” because my friend s had it even worse than me and I have no right to complain about this. 

I thought here was gonna be different from home, but it’s the total opposite. For Australian fellows: is this really a thing here? It is just a bad experience? 
I’m referring my decision about leaving my remote job for this crap. 

Thanks for reading. Just wanted to vent

TLDR: moved from South America to Sydney, I’ve got a shitty job with a boomer and I’m anxious and stressed about it. "

I work from home Monday and Thursday, and next week I have Thursday and Friday off, so I requested to work from home on Monday. According to my job description and company policy, I am allowed to work from home two days a week.

My boss, who also works from home but dislikes me doing so, wanted me to come in on Monday for a project. In his email, he provided a lengthy explanation and stated, ""I am refusing your work from home request."" I replied that I would work from home on Wednesday since I have to be on-site on Tuesday too. That’s all I said.

His response was surprising: ""I think it is important to clarify that WFH is not an entitlement or obligation each week. If your job role/responsibility requires you to be in to support the perations and the employees, you should be in to do so."" He said the decision to WFH on Wednesday is pending however there is nothing that I need to be on site for….

I was shocked because I am always on-site when required. I've been able to work from home since COVID started but chose not to for years to demonstrate my commitment. It wasn't until April when my sister was admitted to the hospital for an organ transplant that I began working from home.

It's like they want a unicorn! And don't get me started on the jargon – ""synergize cross-functional teams to leverage core competencies""? What does that even mean? Just tell me what the job actually is!

Please tell me they've done messed up big time. Customer threw a drink at me last week, they went silent on me and got upset when I needed a few days off before coming back. Upon coming back they basically looked for the first reason to fire me and did. The official reason was I used my phone but there were comments made about the assault too. 

Basically this lady goes from full sympathy and telling me she understands how it feels because she's had a drink throw on her before to basically saying I was playing victim (I hate when people play victim, but I was literally the victim of a violent crime at their business.) 

I think they don't want to deal with it, or help me press charges and find the guy. The day the customer attacked me they told me while everyone has room for improvement in some areas, I've been doing a great job yada yada and we hope to get you where you need to be for a management position... 

Im happy to give further details but there has to be some kind of hostile work environment situation here no? 

They clearly enforced a rule on me out of no where that has never even been brought up. Like I had no written or verbal write ups at this job and had been as perfect an employee I could be. 


I cannot take this market y'all. I need to get a real job. At least this has inspired me to take the time to get my life together and improve myself but I'm seriously in shock.

I was promised in my offer letter a minimum of 30 hours a week (full-time in thier company for benefits). My first two weeks, I got 30 hours exactly. Every week after has been 15-25 hours. My manager says it's because of the store not meeting sales goals, but I truly don't believe my hours should've ever went below the expected minimum. I would've never accepted the offer if I knew that!


Anyway, as soon as they began to slash my hours, I started looking for another job. I found a position at a grocery store and I start next week, but I haven't told my manager I'm leaving. She sat down with me a few days ago and expressed that she's taking two vacations in the next 2 months, and that if I were to quit, she'd need a month notice so that it doesn't overlap with her vacations (I've only been there for a month lol). When I expressed my worries about the hour cuts, she explained that she always makes sure I have at least 30, which is a big fat lie. 


I was going to ghost the place until she mentioned her upcoming vacations. Should I shoot her a text after my last shift to tell her I'm out? Or should I be as petty as she is with my hours and ghost the place? "

97,2024-07-20,Quit after only 1.25 hours on the clock my first day,u/redSocialWKR,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e7uf5j/quit_after_only_125_hours_on_the_clock_my_first/,antiwork,"I'm trying to finish my last two terms of grad school - my internship schedule takes me out of the work I've been doing for 8+ years (federal housing programs at small non-profits). The state won't cover daycare hours for my two young children for grad school; so I needed as many hours as possible in employment in order to pay as little out of pocket as possible for daycare ($538 a week for two children). Took this as a sort of ""on-call"" position as my other part time job suddenly cut everyone's hours (thanks corporate). Manager told me I would train for two shifts and then would be on my own.

After being there for 1.25 hours I'm presented with an employment contract. Two things I have a major issue with on this contract: if I quit with less than 2 weeks notice they will lower my pay to minimum wage for my final paycheck (is that even legal in MI?). Also, contract has what is essentially a 12 month NDA. For a freaking laundry mat!?! Who is going to spill a laundry mats' secrets? And you ALREADY don't trust your employees that much?? Oh and last page of the contract is basically a ""if you say anything against us ever we reserve the right to sue you for every penny you own."" *startled face*

Oh and training period? According to the handbook I'm training for 3 weeks and will make only $12 an hour. After three weeks I'll be making $12.50 an hour (terrible pay but I just needed hours more than anything else). Does it matter that the manager already told me I would only get two training shifts? Nope.

Manager called owner who said they would nix the minimum wage clause but the NDA has to stay because corporate requires it. As she answers the phone she says, ""Well for me it's the rhetoric because this isn't 'just a laundry mat'."" Why? I told her that while I respect that this is his and his wife's retirement, that I will do my job and I will do it DARN well, it isn't my passion. I followed that speal up with, ""If he weren't paying you, would you work here to support his retirement? (She says no) He can't ask more of his employees than he requires of himself.""

This is coming off a terrible experience working for a local small non-profit on a federal rapid rehousing grant. When I tried to report to the state the agencies mis-use of funds and the fact that the tenants would all exit to homelessness (due to deficiencies prior to my hire date) the state said, ""Yea we don't care."" When I asked the non-profits board to meet with me so I could file a formal complaint against the new executive director (per the employee handbook regulations), they scheduled to meet with me and the morning of said meeting the director fired me under ""at-will employment"".

1121,2024-07-20,Oops! No annual raise for anyone,u/Irish_Rock_Scientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e7uobf/oops_no_annual_raise_for_anyone/,antiwork,"Had a company-wide meeting where they went through usual updates and some questions. Company announces there will be no annual raise this year, not even to match inflation. We were due to receive a small bump at the end of summer, in line with their fiscal year ending. On screen was a slide showing the profit margins per quarter, with the profits showing around -2% for this year. 

In almost cartoonish manner, the general manager shows us empty hands and says, ""Look, there's no profit. We can't pay you any extra"". Then proceeds to explain how revenue was all invested back into the company... and we'd have to wait and see what happens next year if there'll be any profit to share.  Not some excuse like the company is facing increased costs, or the market is bad, or anything like that. There has been proven growth this year. Our smaller company has merged with a much larger outfit recently and has considerable reach now. It was completely tone-deaf. Obviously profit margins will be low if revenue is invested back into the company. It's how companies keep tax low, right? Or am I missing something?

Also during this meeting, extra policy (and paperwork) was announced for every employee. We are expected to work more, maintain status quo, and continue to accept a salary with diminishing value. To add insult to injury, the HR department announced a ""fun"" lunchtime learning program that would require employees to sit through ""informal"" learning sessions during one lunchbreak per month. Frankly my department doesn't even take lunch some days because we are working flat out. 

We are already earning below average salaries for our roles. It seems like an employers market out there, and most of my colleagues are willing to grin and bear it due to family responsibilities. I am ready to hand in my notice, but need something else first. Have been applying to so many jobs without much luck. Has anyone been in a similar situation, and how did you navigate it? "

1. Co-workers start typing on the office typewriter just as I was about to make a person-to-person long distance phone call.
2. Getting my new job business cards right the first time in a new job.  It rarely was correct the first time and I would be stuck with a card that had my first name as ""Gichard"" instead of ""Richard.""
3. Wearing a formal three piece suit to my first interview for a career job that paid $19,000 a year.  It was in a conference room.  On a Saturday morning.  There were 14 people around the table including the CEO, CFO, Head of HR, her deputy, his secretary, one person from every other department.  And one person, who did not identify as my future boss.  He did not get to ask me any questions.  The interview lasted from 10AM to 4:30PM.  I got to pee once around 1:30PM when we took a ""10 minute break.""  There was a single all gender restroom just outside the conference room.  For 15 people.  Guess who was last back into the conference room and got a dirty look from the  CEO?  You have guessed correctly.  The job I interviewed for was the lowest entry level position in this government agency.  I was one of 20'ish candidates, and they hired only three.  They made it a point to tell me I was their 3rd choice in the offer letter.  My probation lasted 18 months.  Job was in Texas in a large city.
4. I was required to address every male superior with ""Mr."" and every married female superior as ""Mrs.""  I was encouraged to use ""Miss"" when speaking to single female colleagues.  I could address male peer co-workers by their last name, or their first name if given permission.
5. Official communication was always by those yellow inter-office envelopes.

[Yellow Inter Office Envelope from the 20th Century](https://preview.redd.it/m2e1wq51hodd1.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5b35f990e104e4a5faa93dd2018224e9d74bde2)

1. All correspondence had to be typed out on a personal notepad that you were given at the start of your job.  You received 10 notepads with your name, position title, and date of hire at the top center of the notepad.  You could write informal notes to co-workers and leave them in a personal mailbox.  But if you needed to communicate with a co-worker, or a person in another department, you had to type out your message in a formal style on a typewriter.  It was not unusual to receive your inter-office memo returned with a note from the recipient asking you to correct your typo's, grammar, or other mistakes before your request would be processed or a return answer to your request. Each time you were promoted you received new notepads with your new title.  You had to turn in the old notepads if you had any left.  Using an old notepad after your promotion was grounds for dismissal.  Your new promotion came with a 12 month probation period.
2. Vacation requests had to be submitted via a pre-printed form that required about 20 minutes to fill out.  After you filled it out, you had to make copies for everyone in your section (Mine had about 9 people) and you left a copy of your request in their mailbox to let each person on your team that you would be taking time off. Then you sent the original form via inter-office mail to HR.  You also had to enter your requested vacation on a 90 day forward looking calendar on the wall.  Which I later learned that you could not request vacation more than 90 days before the occurrence.  Which led to me realizing why on I would suddenly get a bunch of vacation requests in my mailbox on the third week of August and the fourth week of September.  My first year there (I started in February) I had to work Thanksgiving and Christmas (double shifts) because there were no vacation slots available by the time I realized I wanted to go home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Not a single one of my co-workers warned me about the 90 day requirement.
3. We didn't have pagers.  We didn't have cellphones.  If I was not physically in the office at my workstation I had to leave a note on the team chalkboard (not whiteboard) saying what time I left and when I was to return and how I could be reached (telephone number) where I was going.  I was required to call back to my office and let the secretary know I had arrived at my destination when I got there, and when I was leaving, and my expected time back at my workstation.  She would document my return to the office when I returned.  I had to initial her time entry on a clipboard.
4. To qualify for my first promotion I had to take a typing test that required a minimum of 45 words per minute.  Typing was rarely part of my job.
5. I was prohibited, via immediate no contest dismissal, from consuming ""intoxicating spirits"" of any kind 24 hours before I entered the office for any shift.
6. I was prohibited, via immediate dismissal, from consuming any ""intoxicating spirits"" if I happened to be near my job location during a period of days off or on vacation (My office was in a large public facility).  If I visited my worksite for any reason (curiosity, travel, spur of the moment) I had to be in business clothes and wearing my ID.  

I stayed at that job for nine years and moved into a different career field around 1998."

My job is a lot easier than his, however, as he works at a fast food joint, and I'm a vape shop worker; all I really do is sit there and fuck around on my phone until a customer comes in, and then clean up the store, count the till, and restock before I leave for the day/night. It's an ideal job for someone like me, who just graduated college and is trying to get my bearings. 

My boyfriend and I both have what some in the autism community call ""low support needs,"" aka we can mostly manage on our own with little to no support from others, but we both still have our moments where we need accommodations. My boyfriend landed this job this past week, and due to the sudden routine change, it's been giving him a lot of anxiety, to the point where he's been crying nearly every morning before going into work. Typically he's okay by the time he gets there, but for the past week my mornings have been spent holding and comforting him. 

I want to clarify that I don't mind this at all, as comforting him comes naturally to me and if I had to do it every day for the rest of my life, I would, without a doubt. But it's rough to see him struggle this much.

I recently interviewed for a salary position and was very hopeful that I would get the job, which would mean my boyfriend wouldn't have to work nearly as much, if at all, because I would've been able to cover our monthly expenses pretty easily. But they never called me back, even after they informed me I'd know in 2 days if I got the position. I haven't heard a damn thing since the interview and it's been over two weeks.

I guess I just wish the working world was kinder to autistic people, that we didn't have to risk a daily meltdown just to be able to earn enough money to survive. I wish that job called me back, and I wish I could earn enough money to where my boyfriend wouldn't have to work.

I work at a top 20 company in the world in terms of market cap and I recently joined as an engineer. 

My manager has been nothing but rude to me for the past month or so. She is speaking to me in an extremely aggressive way, and does not show any type of respect to me all.  

To provide some context, I am hourly paid employee at the company, and it requires extensive travel for 80% of the time. 

On one occasion for example, she got angry that I worked overtime, even tho the job demands that since everytime I travel from home to the new location, it usually is counted as hours worked. 

I guarantee you they do not have a problem with salaried people working overtime, it’s just that I am hourly.


But the point here is, she has been rude to me since I started, and yesterday I couldn’t take it anymore and told her “why are you speaking to me in a condescending way?” And her reply was “I am sorry you feel that way” 

What are my options here? I like this job but I’m not a fan of the manager. I know for a fact that she does not like her manager, should I be reaching out to him and requesting to change who I report to?


What do I do about her rude attitude ? I also keep going calls and meeting set up after my 40 hrs from vendors and other workers. Is there anything that can be said or done?

And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.

For context, I work as a contract worker for a large IT corporation that also works for different companies that use the IT corporation’s products. I had friends from my department move over to a technical support department a few weeks ago. Then, all of a sudden, the company that we support just out of the blue said they did not need technical support anymore so that entire department got laid off.

What makes it worse is that everyone in that department was not given any notice that this was going to happen. My friends told me when they were logging in for the day, they noticed their computers were completely wiped and they were locked out from accessing altogether. On top of that, all of our supervisors just straight up ignored those who were laid off when they were asking for why this is happening.

It pisses me off, not just for my friends, but because we all break our backs trying to work hard and this is the thanks we get. Yes, I work in a work at will state, but the fact that it is one of those feels like we are taken advantage of frequently."

I (16) got my first job at a pizza place in May, a few weeks after my birthday. At first, I really enjoyed, had fun learning to make pizza and making my friends with my coworkers (they’re kind of dicks, but that’s not the point.) School starts for me in less than a month, and I’d really like to take the last weeks of summer to prepare for school, rather than stress over work. There’s a few more reasons than that, but that’s the biggest one (like I’ve worked for two months, and didn’t get paid at all until two weeks ago, and even then it was only for that pay period, not all my hours, what’s with that?) I asked my mom for help, but she wasn’t helpful. I don’t want less hours or anything, I just no longer wish to work there.

I have a few options, one is to simply stop showing up, and don’t answer anybody who calls. I don’t really wanna do that though, I feel like that would leave a bad taste in everybody’s mouth who works there. My other options are to talk to the area manager, or the GM, but he just started working with us yesterday. I don’t wanna have to put in a two weeks notice, I’d like to leave as soon as possible to have as much time as possible, but I have to, I will.

I know many of you guys here hate recruiters, I’m at the point where I do too.

Because of this my management has had me on a PIP since April and I’m starting to feel like this is the very end.

One of the last times someone in my department left, they left voluntarily, and cc’d everyone high up in their resignation calling out my management. When my supervisor and I were on better terms, she alluded to the fact that email had caused a lot of inconveniences for her. Mainly because my management was under the microscope by their management. I found myself inspired by that and want to do the same when it is my time to be let go.

I work remote so I don’t know these people irl. Nor is my plan to necessarily tell anyone “fuck you,” but to outline everything wrong with my department for all my managements management to see. A big problem is my management has implemented policies that don’t work and anyone who questions them is on their chopping block. I want to outline how much they have been detrimental to employees and the organization due to their ego problem.

I don’t think I would get any recommendations from them regardless and I can get a recommendation from coworkers. I’m not very active on LinkedIn either. My first name is generic and I’ll be changing my last name soon anyway. I know this could have implications for the next job or at a future employer but I really want to do this.

1- My professors consistently paired me with a student that I in confidence asked not to be paired with because his behaivour made me uncomfortable. I have evidence of this.

2-  The students are vocally homophobic.

3- They gossip about eachothers abilities negatively which impacts getting work

4- One of them made a parody of a project by a queer person in class

5- most of my classmates fav pastime is bullying this autistic person in class. To an extent they made a weird account online just to mess with him. (The admin did not care)

6- The classmates use the N word frequently and no one is black.

5-  I got long paragraph messages from a couple of kids I was grouped with calling me a faliure and not a real professional (we are students) and how I cant do my job until someone from the faculty had to intervene and tell them it is bullying what they are doing and they kids still didnt back off. they started making weird threats.

6- I have been made to do most of the work and attempted to be thrown under the bus at the same time(attrmpted because I had kept evidence again)

7- The guys talk about womens weight and contantly cry about ""womens rights activists going to far"" - context - in my country honor killing is a thing.

8- A lot of sexual harrasment has happened in this institution

9- Most of my teachers are vocal misogynists and talk about how ""women deterr talened men's success"" 

10- there is no disability accomodation

11- the workload is inhumane and anyone who slips up the slightest is dehumanised and compared and isolated.


I am sort of burnt out and exhausted. I love the course, I am good at the job I want to do and am already getting work here and there but these factors have greatly impacted my mental health especially the cyberbullying and i dont have that much  priviledge to compete with these ppl.

I believe that far too many are too weak willed to say no to the employers and the society. I also believe that it is better to die than to get paid for work, because leaning the devil a finger once usually leads to losing the arm.​

I keep a small bag at all times. At one point I was homeless for a while; but having known that I may have to be like that for a while a prepared, it was no problem.

There seems to be lots of stigma and fear around losing income, access to quality groceries and other comforts, and having to move. This is precisely what advertisers want because it limits the available strategies and make you less likely to do anything. Swallow that you may have to in the worst case live at least for a while frugally (and then at worst case to die homeless); you will notice yourself free to resist. Even families thorough history have been and many are even now poor and homeless with their children living good long lives.

I don't think it's honorable to hand around here, be anxious for your job – knowing that there is something wrong. Surgery is risky & painful, but sometimes taking risks & tolerating pain is the only way to fix things. I would certaintly (were my government to stop paying for my accomodation, ha ha) be homeless again, even when it's dangerous life usually finds a solution: get cold, find a buss stop or knock doors and tell about your situation honestly; get hungry, ask places if they are going to throw away anything and try to find places where they give free food; et cetera.

Does not matter that majority will not take the pains, you should."

I have told them multiple times that if my shifts are going to be cancelled, I need two hours notice because I commute (drive for an hour and pay bridge tolls) and I leave 1,5 hrs before my shift starts.

Well, I get to work today, ten minutes before my shift and I get a message that I've been taken off the schedule today. I ignored it and walked in there and told them that they know I commute and that it is so rude and disrespectful to try to call me off and with such short notice and I am tired of this shit and I'm not coming back.

The manager texted me saying that they offer great pay and benefits, especially for someone with my experience and that I could call them back to talk it out. Manipulation after having my time disrepected?! Go F YOURSELF!

Im not quitting but im going to go on strike. Anyone can join me and are encouraged to do so :)

My reasons are as follows: corporate america has built a system for a workplace that encourages breaking people psychologically such that they neither want to leave the workplace nor fight for more than they have. They will always provide the excuse that the bottom line will be severely nevatively impacted but they refuse to acknowledge that the bottom line has to be so high to feed the top 1% personal bank accounts. While our corporatation does treat us well, they still fall sufferance to the same plagues that other ethical and morally ""in-the-right"" corporations do; which is still the same as above but something worse: by treating basic needs such as healthcare as privliges, by treating employees as interchangeable, and as if we are machines that can work reliably and consistently 40+ hours a day/5-7 days a week, they degrade us from people to workers and thus degrade our needs from human to machine. Not to mention the retail hellscape has shifted severely and the needs, wants, and expectations of consumers is forcing monopolies to occur to begin with and while this will be inevitable, maintaining the current status quo will simply cause all those demands to be met ensuring customer service without placing more into the employees


My strike will end when all employees are entitled to a minimum of $18.50/hr starting pay corporate wide, with all current employees gaining an additional $1.50/hr raise for existing before this change, and all employee wages must be adjusted to accommodate for the wage change. Additionally, all wages must keep up with social security COLA adjustments. In order to accommodate for this i recommend closing the gap from the top 10% of earners in the corporate machine and reallocating below. I recognize small business america cannot do this, but corporate america can and must.

4,2024-07-20,"Should I work this weekend, or rest?",u/MutatedDaisy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e89cp9/should_i_work_this_weekend_or_rest/,antiwork,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting here, and I could use some advice. I realize what reddit sub I'm in so I'm expecting a certain kind of feedback, but I think it might help me some to hear a different perspective than what I am used to.  
  
To start, I have really bad anxiety that is especially triggered by work, all my jobs ever, and the fear of under-performing, getting in trouble, and/or being fired. As such, I am a bit of a work-a-holic, but it's taken a toll on my body.  
  
So the anxiety spiral I am in: should I work this weekend or take a break? Here are the details:

* I have a WFH job I enjoy with a supportive, non-micromanaging manager. I've been here 4-5 months and have done stellar so far with great feedback from managers and co-workers. I feel like I really landed something good here.
* I'm also working on a stressful freelance project that has been ongoing for about 2 years and spilled over into me getting this new FT position. It helps financially but adds a lot of stress to my life.
* I've been juggling both jobs for the past five months without a break, and the freelance job prior for two years alongside 2-3 other gigs at any given time, ultimately worsening my anxiety and depression, and causing frequent panic attacks.
* I do my best to work on the freelance work only before and after hours of my FT, just as an FYI. I care a lot about doing the 'right' thing here because I feel very grateful for the FT job I have.
* I was assigned a new task at my full-time job with an August 31 deadline which I know I can do. But the freelance job picked up this week, increasing my stress and impacting my full-time work performance because I was having panic attacks, GI issues, nausea and sickness, depression, SI, rumination, lack of concentration etc. just from the stress that then snowballed because less productive at work = more anxiety = more symptoms that hinder productivity = less productive at work.
* So this week, I struggled to focus and didn’t accomplish as much as I hoped at FT job. I'm worried about presenting a simple progress report on Monday that our team always does, so there are no hard deadlines or anything I need to 'hit' here, I just don't want to look like I was slacking off. Because, even though my brain is sludge and I got (what i feel is) very little done, I really really tried despite that.

Should I work this weekend to catch up to a place I feel more safe for the progress review, or use the time to recharge? If I don't work, how should I explain my lack of progress to my manager on Monday, if I even need to? I actually do feel I can still get the project done in the time-frame I need, I just had a pretty shitty week...but I don't know how to approach this.

Thanks for any advice!"

113,2024-07-20,"Money based systems are inherently flawed, and humanity will not progress properly until we can figure out how to move beyond them",u/KiIlMePleaze,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e8a1a9/money_based_systems_are_inherently_flawed_and/,antiwork,"Edit: Originally postes to r/unpopularopinion but it got deleted immediately. Figured it might fit here, and curious to hear your thoughts on this take :)


I want to start out by saying I do not think this will happen, I believe money based systems are just too engrained in humanity. I do not think humanity in its current state has the capacity to move beyond this, but regardless I believe that if we want to reach a truly advanced society, money systems will not work.

I believe a proper advanced society would be formulated around the ideas of doing what needs to be done, and doing right by people. I believe the second money is introduced in a system, it frames things entirely by monetary value, which pushes to see profit over moral. Just like school systems have been criticized by grading systems being unfair because boiling down someones intelligence to one number is an over simplification, I believe the same logic applies to monetary value. We are applying a single arbitrary number to things that much more complex.

You can get rich off doing things that actively hurt people, you can get no profit from action that objectively have merit. Monetary value systems don't ethically work or reward what should be rewarded, which is the merit of actions. If someone is kind and helps people, but has low work ethic, they are view less successful. Yet these actions have significant merit. Maybe their kindness stopped someone from hurting multiple other people, or hurting themselves. Bettering the world.

On the other side, if you have a work ethic that allows you to get a career, but are very kind, you are still very much viewed as successful. Even if your actions have hurt people for your own gain.

I think financial success is viewed too highly as something of good merit. It's not a definite way to view success. It could show you have the drive do what needs to be done, which can be good. But it can show you have the drive to do WHATEVER need to be done to benefit you, which is bad.

It's a well known fact that the way our brains are evolved doesn't align with modern society. It explain addiction, and is exploited by games, media, entertainment, etc. Our brains evolved to keep dopamine and happiness, because those things we're readily available way back in the past, so we evolved to pursue these things at any time to get what we need. In the modern age, always seeking what you feel you want or need noe actively works against us. It's readily available, and so our brains just want more and more and more because they aren't in the environment they are supposed to be in.

I think money systems are the epitome of systems that feel good because they exploit the flaws in our evolution. It brings out our greed, it reframes what's important, it gives you and ever present gain to chase, and I truly believe this actively hurts us. Human greed will always exist, but I don't think it can prosper in the same way in a moneyless society. You wouldn't be able to automatically gain power and respect just be earning more. If you exploited and stole from people, you'd be condemned, not rewarded. Instead of gaining financial power, you could strive to gain social status, which would be based more on the good you provide and merit of you actions, rather than sheer amount of grind and perservence. I think the important thing is that human ambition would never be killed, but money systems take advantage of human ambition.

I really like the ideas proposed is the show The Orville. I know it's based off Star Trek but I've never seen Star Trek so I don't know how it varies. In that show, matter synthesis was created, which made money useless. In one of the episodes someone from a modern day Earth equivalent asks ""So why does anyone do anything?""

He talks about how you can do nothing if you want, but when you basic needs are met, that gets boring. What becomes the new ""currency"" is status. What you offer to the world. Status can only be obtained by doing right by the world, not by exploiting it.

She also asks ""So society is perfect then?"" to why he replies ""Well, we still have like inlaws and stuff.""

While it's a bit of a silly answer, I think the idea it points to is broader. It wouldn't be utopia, theres still everyday life issues, theres still problems that needs solving. But I find the difference is that a society like that rewards actually fixing and improving things, not benefitting yourself off of it.

Obviously we don't have matter synthesis, and never will, but that show has always has my favourite portrayal of a ""realistic"" advanced society, because things aren't perfect. They still have issues with bad people, they still have problems to solve, they still have ethical dilemmas. But it's not weighed down by the idea of profit or monetary gain.

That's about it."

2,2024-07-20,Is this retaliation?,u/After-Quiet-995,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e8co80/is_this_retaliation/,antiwork,"I am a nurse on a small mental health unit. I have a manger and she has a boss who is the director of the unit. We had a different director who interviewed me and hired me years ago (keep this is mind). 

So a year ago we had a girl named Samantha (alias) be hired on as a patient care tech. On her first day we mad causal conversation, I asked about her family, school like, etc. Samantha then followed me on Instagram and I noticed she was the directors sister. She had never mentioned this when I asked about her siblings. When it was mentioned to our manager we knew, in a hushed tone she stated “how’d you find out?” 

Fast forward to a week ago. My coworker was voicing concerns to our manager. In this she stated that she was hesitant to voice issued about Samantha due to her being the directors sister and that she shouldn’t be able to work on the unit due to this. The manager got defensive and stated it wasn’t an issue due to Samantha not “reporting” to the director and that she reports to her (the manager). She stated she has addressed all concerns about Sam already and that it wasn’t an issue. She then went to the director and told a skewed version of this.  

The director then emailed us with the HR policy on family relationships and it actually stated that “direct or indirect supervision is not allowed with relatives”. She then proceeded to state that she encourages us to go to HR and voice any “favoritism” we have witnessed and be able to give specific examples (no EVER said the word favoritism). She also said she is not Samantha’s (her sisters) boss essentially (I was hired by the director). She never mentioned anyone’s name in the email except our managers. She referred to herself as the mangers “one-up” and she referenced her sister as the “concerned employee”. 

I guess this seems like retaliation since we had talked to the manager about it and then the director comes emailing us after the manager addressed it. The email was extremely passive aggressive and rubbed me the wrong way. I haven’t responded to the email, should I or do I let it go?  "

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I’ve been in a bit of a predicament lately. Some big life changes have happened, and it’s all good family news. The only issue is we have to move outside of a normal commute from my current position. I’m a software developer, so all my work could be done remotely. 

However, when I posed this to my company, I was basically instantly shut down. I’ve been working for them for over five years at this point, I’m able to support legacy and new systems alike, and they just aren’t willing to keep me. They even said something along the lines of “you can just commute that twice a week, what’s the big deal?” 

The big deal being it would total almost 12 hours of driving over two days per week. 2.5-3 hours one way, not to mention the very real threat of traffic adding even more time. I would basically be spending 14-16 hours of two days out of my week on the job. 

So I’ve started the paperwork for resignation. Only to be hit with the concern that they’re right. We start our move at the end of the month, with me planning on continuing to work until my current lease expires. But then I’m done. I can’t afford two different apartments worth of rent, don’t want to have to spend the money on getting a hotel every week, etc. 

But I have nothing lined up. The job market fucking sucks right now, it seems. I’ve been reaching out, applying to as many positions as I can, but not getting any bites yet. We’ve got a small nest egg, probably enough to last us between half a year to a year, but my anxiety is making me worry it won’t be enough. That I won’t be able to find anything in my field. I worry that they’re right, and I should just suck it up and be miserable. At least until I find something else (but who knows how long that’d take?)

I dunno. I guess I needed to vent. But maybe someone has some advice. "

I try to make meeting quick to get him the Fuk out my office. Welp, fast forward about a week later the same Saggy hairy balls made an appearance again. Okay, WTF!! Again I carried on (I'm 52 I've seen quite a few balls in my day) and give him the benefit of the doubt... Here we are and it's happened 2 more times. This guy has never been creepy w/ me or came on to me. Part of me is like he doesn't know Pete and Re-Pete are swaying in the wind. But then I'm like how can he NOT know they hang so damn low they hit the chair! I don't want to take to HR and I just don't know how to have that conversation... Any advice? "

She finishes up after he normally gets off work so he only needs two hours a day off.  Lately, there company has had a lot of OT and they are requiring everyone to stay four hours after their regular shift and to work on Saturdays, too.  He is told he must use FML hours if he wants the extended hours off.   Including his half-hour each way comute time, this will increase his FML hours from 10 hrs/wk \* 48 wks/yr = 480 hours per year, well under the annual FMLA threshold, to about 30 hrs/wk \* 48 wks/yr = 1440 hours per year that is about 400 hours over the maximum available under FMLA.  The good news is that the OT started on July 1 so he should squeak under the max hours this year.  The bad news is that if something goes wrong, he would likely run out of hours before the year's end.  Should he exceed the allowable FML hours, is he elegable for reasonable accomidation under ADA, or is there another alterntitive?  His mom was aready turned down for a visiting nurse during he dialisis."

Our GM makes the whole staff feel terrible about ourselves and seems to find something new every day to go off on us about. 

But just looking through job listings has become really discouraging, to the point where the end of the world as we know it, sounds like sweet relief. 

I don’t have a four year degree or any specialized experience, and it seems that’s pretty much a requirement for any lateral movement. 

Each time I see something that looks slightly interesting, they require a bachelor’s degree, tons of experience, a CDL, or some kind of certificate. 

I’ve had multiple colleagues over the years leave or get fired and end up somewhere that makes them much happier and pays them more than what we make here. 

But for my recent job search, this has been far from the case. 
Am I pretty much going to have to go back to school or get a certificate, or be forced to try to get into sales? Or is there something out there for me? 

I am losing pretty much any faith I had that I’m going to find a decent job that pays anything close to what I’m making now. This whole thing just really sucks. Where are the good jobs?!

I’ve been working my current first job ever for about a month now (I work at a hospital) but it’s given me so much hell already. My employers have been so shady since the interview, I wasn’t even 100% sure if it was a paid position because the job posting was vague and it felt awkward to ask during the interview, so I asked a few days before my first shift just to confirm it was paid and WHAT was the pay because they never told me. Also, my interview was in April and they told me they should have a decision by early June but I don’t know *what* about this job took that long to decide a candidate (I feel they also hired someone else during this gap)

I was also unaware it would be a contract position until they sent me the onboarding forms, I was a little hesitant but decided to accept anyways (I think they’ve misclassified me but that’s another story). It’s a part time position but I didn’t know part-time meant they would only be giving me 6 hours a week with payday being once a month. What makes me think I might be let go soon is around the time of my first day, I noticed a job posting for basically my position, but full time. This kind of irked me because I’m a technician and there is only 1 station to work at for us techs meaning we have to be scheduled on different days (there’s only 1 other tech I’m aware of and we’re scheduled on different days). 

So if this posting is for a full time position, and since I’m a “contractor” I’m assuming I can be let go at any time and I can’t see how a full time position would work in this scenario without letting me go. But anyways the job posting finally closed today after 5 weeks of being open so I’m assuming that means they hired someone?🙃"

I know gaslighting is an overused word, would it apply in this situation?

I was doing some work for a friend, running her shop a few days a week. She told me the payment was £11.45 per hour (1p above minimum wage), but as she’s a friend I didn’t think to make sure this was in writing (big mistake obviously!)
Anyway my most recent wages worked out at £10.13 per hour, so was £50 short based on what she’d said.
I messaged her to ask for clarity about payment and this was her response:

“Hello lovely!sorry I always have loads of kids running around and it's hard to write (even as we speak 😂)I was going to message you anyhow to speak about this..as I think way back when (when I was going to open the other shop) I think we said £50 a day with it being cash in hand...but then I thought (but I could be wrong ) we had said £10 an hour but I decided to pay £11 anyway and always round it up as I'm  paying cash so I just did it as a little bonus...but I was going to message to say that I'm happy to do £11.50.. This morning I thought I was rounding it up but I've obviously been mistaken...I hope that makes sense?let me know if it doesn't!”


Absolutely none of these conversations happened. I haven’t seen her in person and I can check through our conversation so I know I’m not misremembering. None of these numbers match what she actually paid me. Why claim she was going to message me to pay me more AFTER she’d underpaid me - also she paid me a week late anyway so that’s a lot of time to send that message, so why wait til after I’d messages to clarify? It’s very convenient eh.
She then went on a big guilt trip thing about how much she does, so I went and handed in my keys, not because of the payment issue but because her reaction and trying to convince me several conversations that didn’t happen, HAD happened!!

 I know she will paint it as she made a human mistake and I let her down, but if it’s a human mistake why invent these multiple conversations instead of just saying sorry.

I feel so weird and awful about it and need some validation!"

They're not local as one phone number was in another part of the state, and a WhatsApp number from outside the US.

Long story short she needed to log into this crypto ATM so she asked me to log into it and I had to put my social, phone number, driver's license and a face scan into it before we realized these are scammers. Our other coworker messaged the boss and asked if she was supposed to be putting lots of money into the ATM and he said no then asked why. It felt kind of odd but I figured it was nothing, now I know not to give that kind of information as part of my job. The scammers got several thousand dollars from her before she stopped.

As far as I know my sensitive information didn't go straight to the scanners, but I'm concerned that now they have my identity through the ATM. Also, now I heard through a co-worker that the owner of the store wants us to stay quiet about it and that it's a ""private situation to be handled in house"". My boss wants me to make a police report when I go in today. 

This feels like it is A violation of at least a few work laws here in the US and I certainly don't like the idea that they're telling me to keep it between them and my co-workers when it's my personal information involved. Already called my bank and had them block my cards. I suspect my coworker is playing dumb but is in on it as she asked me a few days ago about crypto and it just seems suspicious in general.

Have any of you guys ever been in a similar situation ? What pointers and advice do you have moving forward? This all just started last night.

I typed out the below but Reddit wouldn’t let me post since it was to long lol. And I accidentally took an extra dose of adderall this morning. Anyway, thought some of you would enjoy reading it (if you can, I’m a long winded bastard I apologize)



Insinuating people who are calling for lower hour work week time “weak” is honestly some of the most uneducated, bootlicker, corporate kiss ass shit I have ever heard. I’m about to write a fuck ton and I doubt you actually comprehend or read any of it but I accidentally took an extra adderal and people like you piss me off so fuck it. If I change your mind I welcome you with open arms tho, all love bro.


Here’s the thing, 40 hour work weeks were primarily  “designed”for factory jobs (Henry Ford actually was the first one to normalize it, solely so his employees could have the actual time/wages to go out and buy his model T’s), or really I should say mandated by the government so that employees weren’t worked to death, because if companies  could make you work 80 hours with no OT they absolutely would, hell they employeed literal children back in the day. In fact they still do, just children in countries that aren’t here and don’t have labour laws or don’t have laws that are enforced (in fact though, they still do it to children from foreign countries actively in america right now too, but that’s another tangent that will make this 10 paragraphs longer, if you want to personally know more about it look up the raids on Tyson meats and US Hyundai factories among others, and I’m not talking back in the 70’s-90’s I mean literally right now). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the average amount of time spend working was around 20 hours a week. Even today, modern day tribes that are still living a nomadic hunter gatherer live style work around 20 hours every week. I’d love to see anyone try to convince me they work harder than tribes that have to literally chase down and hunt animals and forage for food to not starve to death for their entire lives. I think one of the best examples of how our perceptions have skewed is modern medias depictions on the back breaking work of pre revolution farmers, who many people look at and thank god they have the luxury of wasting only 40 hours of every week of their life. Often, and somewhat correctly depending on the context, families are shown as working 12-16 hour days in the fields 7 days a week, digging, planting, and harvesting by hand with extremely crude tools. While yes this is true for a small percentage of extremely poor small family owned and operated farms, most farms and homesteads had hired help. Horses and other large livestock for plowing have been around for centuries. Plows also weren’t for the only tools at their disposal. Even kings/governments would provide needed help for farms on occasion, because what use is ruling a country/kingdom if all your citizens starve to death (Stalin didn’t get the memo).  But the biggest thing I think people do not realize, is that field upkeep, plowing, planting and harvesting, even if it is you and your family is doing it for 12-16 hours a day for months *is that growing seasons are not a year long affair*. You prepare the field, plow the field, plant the seeds, maintain the crops, and harvest. Maybe a couple times a year if you’re lucky or if you have crops with different growing seasons (most back then focused on 1 crop usually though, but some crops you can get 2 or more harvests), and then your keep what will get you and family through winter, and sell the rest. You, your family, and employees then are done farming until the next year. Did they just lay on the couch watching tv like we all would today? No, but they now had much, much, much more time for personal endeavors, hobbies, improvements to their house/home/land/ whatever they wanted or needed until the next growing season started again. Guess what all that averages out to? 20 hours a week. Yes, in all fairness there were some extremely challenging periods mixed in. This is also all dependent on your growing zone of course though, the zone 1 with the shortest growing season being 100 days up to zones 10-13 having year long growing seasons. It is important to know though different zones have different crops that can be grown, and even with 10-13 having year long growing seasons crops are never grown year round, at least not in the same fields as they take time to recover after a harvest especially without a lot a fertilizer which wasn’t  a trivial thing to source in large quantities back then. With all that said, I’d still be willing to bet a large amount of people would be willing to work 60-80 hour weeks if it meant they had 3-6 months off a year to get that get that 20 hr a week average.


But back to why the 40 hour week model works well for factory jobs. For example, say you have 10 employees on a line, they work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 40 hours total. You let the line run for a week/month or longer to build initial stock and keep track of the metrics and now management/owners know exactly how much product can be completed in a day/week/month (barring people out sick, if that was even a thing for your job / supply chain issues, etc. but at least a rough estimate).  Now, when other company clients or consumer customers want to buy the products coming off the line, you have a rough estimate of what amount of product you can sell them, and what time frames it will take to produce the goods for various orders if your backstocks aren’t sufficient, and what will you need in men and assembly lines if you need to expand. Your company starts doing better than expected and you can’t fulfill orders in a reasonable time frame? You can add more lines or people, or do 24/7 rotating shifts and you can hire more people. Factory is at full capacity? Build a new one. New tech comes along to make things quicker? Add it in and update the metrics. The model is fantastic, if not a little dehumanizing and soul crushing for the line employees, for a manufacturing factory to product based business, which from the early ish 1900’s to about the 80’s is what a vast amount of companies were doing. It’s what every exec hopes for, a simple, easily scalable venture to rake in money. Back in the day, this was one of the best career paths for most people. You get hired at a factory, you do your 40 hours, and you (mostly) make enough money to support your family, buy a house, hell you could usually even take a few nice vacations a year. Who knows, maybe one day you could move off the line to a higher position. The age of booming US physical product production was great (economy and quality of living wise, at least for most if not for you know, the whole racial and social issues side etc) and is what truly created the middle class in America. You didn’t need a college degree, an internship, or hell you barely ever needed a highschool diploma and you could easily land a job good enough to have a decent home, your family provided for, shoot even maybe a couple vacations every year, even if the job effectively made you the equilevant of a robotic arm for 40 of your waking hours for a lot of Americans this was the American dream. Hell, a lot of fathers working at factory had the expectation that their son/‘s would come to work at the same factory as them when they turned 18 back then. I know I’ve gotten on a bit of a tangent but my main point for the above sections is to show that 40 hours at a factory was easy to get, made sense, paid well, and was looked at as something to be proud of, even if the job itself wasn’t fulfilling for many. It still didn’t need to be 40 hours a week, they could have hired more staff and done shorter rotating shifts, everyone got paid the fucking same anyway, but whatever, we will move on just for the fact that most Americans were ok with it back it then, and a lot (not all) people could live comfortably.

These days? Those factory/plant jobs are practically non existent. Companies quickly realized decades ago they didn’t have to pay livable salaries to Americans if some factory (sweat shop) in east/South Asia would make their products for Pennies on the dollar, they didn’t have to deal with the employees at all, and to this day they don’t (even if they claim to) give a single fuck if the factory making their shit is employing literal children as young as 10 years old, if not younger. They don’t give a fuck if the employees are paid the equilevant of 5$ a week(regardless if they work 40 or 80 hours) in whatever country it’s in. For fucks sake these corporations  don’t even care if these factories have to install **literal suicide prevention nets to stop people from commuting suicide from jumping from the 10 story of the factory because the pay, hours, and conditions are so awful** Are they all this bad? No, but I’ve read enough to know a lot are, and those are just the ones I know about or that other parties know about. The simple fact is no human should have to work in any conditions like this, and anyone who disagrees is either a sociopath, purely evil, or brain dead. Rough right? And no I’m not directing any harsh comments at op or the reader, but if you read the above section and think it’s ok or tried to justify it in your head, well, fuck you.

if you’ve read this far thanks, I just felt I needed to provide context on a lot of things for what I am saying to be an affective argument. Only a few paragraphs left I promise, probably with more tangents and possibly unneeded context, I can’t help myself lol.

Okay, so what jobs are the younger generations getting these days? If all the “shit, soul sucking factory jobs are gone surely they must be doing great, right?”. No actually! Most are doing worse than any generation in the US that wasn’t in the Great Depression, or generations of youth that got forced into some war we (probably) needlessly joined. If youth today are fortunate or hardworking enough to obtain a college degree, get an intern ship, and are in general extremely lucky they may land a good gig that pays well and has benifits (health insurance, 401k, etc) and now they get to spend 40 hours a week and as much as 2.5 to five more hours a week if you have a commute. Oh, and the real kicker is that almost all high skill/education jobs are salary exempt, meaning no over time. That 40 hours you agreed to can easily and quickly become 50+ hours a week, all of it away from their families, hobbies, friends, etc, and the commute and OT are all unpaid! (Mostly, some people can get milage pay and/or are not OT exempt, but goodluck finding that in an entry level position).

Ok, but what if they don’t have a degree but went to trade school? They will likely be paid well and have benefits, a lot of the time making more than most people with non STEM degrees, at least early on. Honestly a really great option right now for younger people, or even older if you are in decent shape. The downside here is, if not very careful, is that their body will likely be too worn down to continue work before they even hit retirement age, especially if they aren’t able to make it into a position with less manual labor within their industry. It is effectively gambling that you can outlast the damage your career physically does to you either until you can save enough to retire or that you can move up the ladder to less demanding jobs in the industry. And the worst part? If you do damage your body badly enough you may not be able to pivot into a role that does not involve physical labour, simply because you could be in constant, debiliting pain. I know I sound like I’m being dramatic, but I personally have had a father, cousins, and friends that this has happened to. If I know that many personally, it is a scary thought to imagine how many men this has unfortunately happened to. On top of all the above, manual labour is ententiled to OT, but this isn’t exactly a blessing because many companies can and will make you work 50-60+ hour weeks. I do still encourage people to pick up a trade if they are interested, but you need to take real, educated, careful of your health and body in general. 

Now, what about kids that did neither of these schooling options, either due to a poor upbringing, a lack of funds, or simply being a stupid 18 yo kid like all of us were at one point? Well, the vast majority of them are going to be working dead end, low paying, little to no benifit jobs for the rest of their life unless they can pivot into some type of schooling, finding a shit job but with lots of upward mobility, or starting their own venture. Not going to school and not having a plan at 18 isn’t the end of the world. But you need to have some sort of plan in your head by 21, and you need to be actively working toward that plan once you make it. Don’t flip burgers at Burger King your whole life. You could always join up in the military as well if you have no idea what you want to do at 18, at least then your getting paid while you think and you’ll have a ton of benefits when your out. Or stay in if you want, it’s not that bad honestly. If you stay a private your whole career though the same things I said about manual labour applies to you too though. Have fun filling those sand bags.


Obviously, there are exceptions to all of these cases, as well as more options I’m not taking account of but for the vast majority of the youth in America the above is what their future holds.

Finally, (I know, my bad, I promise to never double up on my adderall again lol) to the main point of working 40 hour weeks I can give you multiple examples of how shortening the work week to at least 30 hours (keeping salaries the same and bumping hourly to match) can if not fix, can at the least alleviate some of the issues for all 3 scenarios for youth employment I mentioned above, and most of it will also apply to people well into their careers.


1: The college educated kids that landed good jobs in the hypothetical are already in good(ish, most of this does still apply though) positions, so I want to provide examples for college educated kids that were not so lucky, either be it for low grades, a low in demand field, or if they were unsuccessful in finding an internship while in school. Basically these kids are going to for one, have a difficult time landing a job *period*. Seriously, even with a bachelors, most industries will still hire these kids into entry level positions only. If you don’t believe me, go to linked in, indeed, whatever and search for entry level jobs. Not only is the pay laughable for people who just spent god knows how much on a degree, but the job requirements absolutely insane, even if the pay was great. For example, I personally work IT and have a decently high up position in my company. I keep an eye on indeed for openings in my city and no exaggeration,  
9/10 “entry level positions” I see are asking kids to do the roles of an entire team of people for the pay of less qualified person. Not to mention they all want at least 2 year’s experience for “entry level”. So, this means they are going to have to go find a job that they are over qualified for, apply, and if they are “lucky” get fucked over on their pay for at least 2 years to even have a hope of getting a slightly better but still super shitty job. So, how does a 30 hour work week help? They can spend those greatly needed hours obtaining certifications (which often count toward experience), learning new skills, and job hunting, among also of course, doing things they actually fucking enjoy or seeing their friends and family.

2. For labourers. This one is more complicated a bit, since first in my opinion labourers should be paid a base salary (not getting paid for 2 weeks because it’s raining is absolute bullshit) and I also believe OT should be opt in. Forcing someone to work 50+ hours a week or facing getting punished/fired should absolutely be illegal imo. If you need the money or don’t mind, go for it though. With that said if labourers had 30 hour work weeks max, with optional OT on top, the could spend the time relaxing, recovering, or even doing cardio/stretching/weightlifting work to strengthen their bodies for longevity. Your emoloyees help is never worth a project getting completed on time. If your boss has your team pulling 50+ hour weeks, he can get his out there and do it, he fucked up, not you guys.


3. For uneducated/unskilled workers. And I’m not knocking you guys by saying uneducated/unskilled, I worked in kitchens and waited tables for years, I know the shit is hard work. With that said, I do believe you guys should be paid a base salary (every job should imo) for waiters, you guys make tips and I know most of you already don’t 40 so, well, your good. To my boys in the kitchen, fuck hourly, find a job with salary, and if your manager understaffs your kitchen and calls you in tell him to eat a dick if you worked your 30 and aren’t getting OT. If you’re good they won’t fire you ;) or if they do they’ll call you back in a week to come back and give you a raise. For everyone else, I honestly don’t know anymore for the 30 hour week arguments I could make for you guys, been a while since I’ve beeen in that boat. But I’d love to hear ideas if you guys have any.


Lastly, to any bootlickers, managers, owners, whatever, I already know your main argument against a 30 hour week. “BUT WE HAVE 40+ HOURS OF WORK TO DO A WEEK, WE NEED PEOPLE HERE FOR ALL OF IT” then hire more people and rotate. That fucking simple. If you can’t afford to hire enough staff, pay them appropriately, and ensure they have a work life balance then you can’t afford to run your business. Maybe don’t buy that second boat or give the CEO another multi million dollar bonus this year and the hiring budget will grow a bit. Eat a dick


If you read this far I love you and if you want to have casual debates on any topic dumb or intellectual let me know. Even just shooting the shit. I moved to a new city and have no friends yet so ya boy venting here. All love"

It comes with the territory. I am not complaining about that. I just get home today and  someone calls off. 


Now, I was planning on seeing my family whom I haven't seen in 6 days (they went camping), and I am so burned out for covering my own shifts which are 10 to 12 hours a day and changing my sleep schedule almost every single day, dealing with everything my job entails.

Guy calls off. I ask my husband if I can quit my job. I can uber/Lyft until I find a new job. He isn't happy but he understands. 


How can I tell my boss that I am not covering this guys shift? I have plans at home ive been pushing off for weeks because I've been working
. Basic home care needs like weeding my yard, cutting grass, etc. That I can't do unless I have an off day because I could go to work at 10 am and not get home until 8 pm. I could go to work at 2 pm and not get home till midnight. I'm tired of this. 


My boss won't ever lift a finger to help unless.absolutely required. God forbid, it's Sunday and he would have to, he ain't worked a Sunday since he's been there. 


The exact text from the guy calling off said, hey, I have to call off because x,y,x and I sent this to the gm and he said send it to you. 



I had just started to weed my front bed. I want to just send him a text that says, ""Yeah, no"" and call it quits. Because I feel so taken advantage of.

22,2024-07-21,Staffing agency claiming I never worked and refusing to pay me. What do I do? ,u/jmh1881v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e8rth4/staffing_agency_claiming_i_never_worked_and/,antiwork,"Recently I applied through a staffing agency for a gig job which was supposed to be 2 days of work at $25 an hour. I worked the first day and clocked in and out though the app as they told me to do. I clocked in at 8am and out at 5pm. The second day I ended up not being able to work because my mom got into a pretty serious car accident. I texted the staffing manager 2 hours before the shift to let her know what happened and to tell her I couldn’t work the second day. She never responded. 

Anyway, flash forward a couple days and I get an email from HR saying they need all new employees to have a zoom meeting to verify their I9 documents. I did this on Wednesday and at that meeting the He person said “I saw you worked on the 12th, so you’ll be paid on the next payday which is Friday”. I said ok great and asked if there’s anything else she needed. She said no

So Friday comes around. I don’t get paid. I thought well, there was the Microsoft outage so maybe that’s it. Saturday morning comes and I’m still not paid so I send an email to HR. They reply and claim their records show I worked 0 hours and will have to contact the staffing manger to confirm I was there

Problem with that is this was a massive event with over 100 employees and I never even talked to the staffing manager in person. So I went into the app to find my shift so I could send it to HR only to see that my clock in and out time had been DELETED. 

So basically I now have no proof that I worked this shift. I don’t know if this was a genuine mistake or if they purposely deleted my shift but either way what do I even do here ?"

Long story. I've been a senior analyst (IT) for 5 years.  I've been training new analysts, helping other analysts with their questions/issues, standing up new procedures, creating and updating knowledge base articles, working on projects... duties that are listed under an expert/lead level.

For the past 3 years, I've been receiving high marks (exceeds expectations). I've been given a year long ""highly visible"" project involving different departments in a different region, it went smoothly.  I also obtained my MBA with honors within these 3 years. (Yes, it is from a university in my area that has a campus and several sport  teams 🙂)

Last fall, I was moved to another group (with a new supervisor) that is known for more complicated and ""delicate"" work. Historically, a move to this group also meant a promotion. Fast forward a few months, I was informed there is no promotion for this group anymore. Ok, great, I'll continue to kick butt. Another couple of months down the road, I find out spots for promotions are drastically cut to 1 to 2 promotions a year for the whole department. This really got me down because I've been excelling for years without a bump, other than 5% pay raise per year, and we are a very large group. The last round of promotions was at the beginning of this year, which must have been the last ""large"" round of promotions.

Since I am new to this group, I've been basically ""reset."" I've been told I do not qualify for a promotion because I am no longer an expert in my area, and my history of exceeding expectations does not matter.

Honestly, I feel cheated of a promotion. It didn't happen while I was exceeding expectations for 3 years, doing jobs listed for lead/experts for 5 years. It's not going to happen in this new group because of decreased of opportunities of promotions and I'm basically a newbie in the group.

 I no longer have the drive to exceed, I just want to do enough to keep my job, I don't care if I get a 3% raise. I worked hard for a promotion,  not a measly 5% raise."

I get paid well, it's not especially stressful, and it's a job that fits right in with a lot of my non-work hobbies and actually helps me to pursue them.  But recently I've been feeling frustrated with our policy for time off because a bunch of my coworkers have been coming in while clearly sick.

At my job we have paid time off that accumulates depending on how many hours you've worked.  The PTO is what is used for both normal vacations, and also time off for illness or other medical leave.  The frustrating thing is that it can take a really long time to accumulate PTO, and your entire stash of PTO can get wiped out by getting sick once.

In fact, I actually got really frustrated with the policy a few months ago because I was planning on getting a small surgery, but then caught COVID and had to be out of work for a few days.  It wiped out almost all of my PTO and then I had to wait about 3 months before I had saved up enough to take time off for my surgery, and even then wasn't able to take off enough time as I had initially wanted to.

I know that this is seemingly pretty normal at other workplaces in the US, but I've noticed that we don't seem to actually have any specific policies about what happens when you run out of PTO and *have* to be absent for illness, or otherwise don't want to use PTO for being sick.  For me, I don't have a lot of expenses in my life so when I was sick previously I would've been fine with not being paid for the days I was out sick so it didn't wipe out my PTO and make me push back other things.  I think I saw something in our employee handbook that eventually after you've been with our company for a while you can request non-paid time off, but it didn't really explain it.  

It's really annoying now with COVID or the flu or whatever popping up practically every other month because it seems like it could quickly lead to a cycle of never actually being able to take time off for anything on your own if you're someone who gets sick easily.  My partner lives in another country and I'm trying to save up time off to see her soon but if I catch something from all my sick coworkers right now I would likely have to push that back by like literally half a year.  

I dunno, was just wondering if any of you guys work somewhere with a similar policy and how best to deal with it, or any other advice in this type of situation.  "
8,2024-07-21,Advice: walking time counted as break? (UK) ,u/Account18764347,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e8vgx9/advice_walking_time_counted_as_break_uk/,antiwork,"Ok, so. Where I work, we get 1 break a shift. Unpaid, 30 minutes (shifts are 7.5 hours).

I work in a busy, large (They love to boast about how large this new place is) warehouse. Most jobs require scanning of products etc. This gives us ""transaction times"". They are getting really strict with breaks, and keep hammering down that breaks are ""transaction to transaction"", meaning the 30 minutes starts from when you last confirmed something before break, and doesn't end until you scan something else in after. They have said that walking time isn't a thing, and that time taken to get from our stations to the canteen/smoking shelter etc and back is all part of our break. Depending where you are, even walking at a brisk pace would take 5 minutes to get out of the main warehouse and into the corridors (taking 10+ minutes out of your break time overall).

Is this common practice? Is this something we can actually try to fight against, or are we just going to have to suck it up? Obviously, none of us are happy about this.

I seem to recall reading somewhere that legally break times only counted when taken away from your work area. Could we perhaps argue that since they say the entire warehouse is our work area, as we're expected to go to any department we're sent (as we're ""warehouse colleagues"", and not just a colleague of X, Y or Z department) that until we're out of the actual warehouse area we're still in a work zone and so not legally on break? 

Is there anything we can do to push back? "

This employee wasn't fired for smelling bad, or being generally unkempt. She was fired for wearing her uniform two days in a row and not BUYING a different shirt.

Having been that girl, I'd bet her shirt was clean. I have washed my work shirts in bathtubs when I was serving $100 plates.

If they do fire my kid, do they have any recourse in getting unemployment? Can they be refused UI because they were fired for not doing double or triple the amount of work they were hired to do? 

Do you have any advice for me to pass on to them? I'm at a complete loss.

As we all know, the hiring process is never fun, but this recent experience has really left a sour taste in my mouth, and makes me wonder whether there's even a point in trying. 

After applying at a well-known chain restaurant, I was asked to come in for an interview the next day with the BOH manager. I think the interview went great. That being said, I wasn't offered a job right away, but instead asked to meet with the GM for a SECOND interview a few days later. For a part-time cook job. But, whatever — that interview goes great too, and it ends with me getting hired.

Flash forward to a few days later, and I'm at my unpaid orientation at the restaurant. The orientation went fairly well, but another new girl and I were strong armed by the GM into signing up for some program where we donate a portion of our paycheck to ""employees in need"". I think it's complete bullshit that a multi-million company is forcing its lowest-paid employees to make up for their unwillingness to pay people a fair wage, but with the GM staring me down like that, I couldn't really say no. At the end of the orientation, the GM told me that I would be contacted by the BOH manager in a couple of days to set up my training schedule. Cool!

Plot twist — it's been over a week and I still haven't heard a single word from either the BOH or GM. I have no idea what's going on, but I'm beginning to suspect that I was let go before my job even really started. I can hear the comments already: ""Why don't you just call the restaurant and get this all straightened out?"" I DO agree that's the logical response to this situation, but I'm honestly just so tired of all the circus tricks and bending over backwards that's required of us to simply get paid nowadays. This isn't some high-paying, high-ranking corporate position — it's a kitchen job. Why should I be reminding the manager to do her job before I've even started working there? 

I just don't understand anymore. I'm so tired of it all. I'm frustrated with all the steps required to just get a simple, low-stakes, entry-level job. And I'm sure that I'm not the only one. 

TL;DR: I was hired for a job then never given a training schedule by the management team. "

_________________ 


I (29f) was in a vulnerable state mentally, dealing with a lot of trauma, and feeling suicidal when my doctor (39m) offered me a job at his clinic, implying he would provide me with a safe space to work. Not long after I started working there, I found bloody needles improperly disposed of in the garbage. My coworker also discovered needles disposed of unsafely. An email was sent out emphasizing the importance of using the sharps container for needle disposal. Despite this, I encountered a needle again while taking out the garbage, which pricked my leg. This led to me undergoing a protocol and starting on HIV medication, an experience that was extremely distressing due to my diagnosed OCD.

One of the people likely responsible for the improper disposal texted me personally, questioning why I was put on HIV meds, suggesting that ""sometimes these things just happen."" This individual works in healthcare but does not have a physician's license. I requested my boss, who is also my doctor, to fill out a work incident report. It took insisting that I wouldn't return to work until it was done. He eventually filled it out himself, but I didn't sign anything. When I asked if I needed to report the incident to OSHA, he claimed he would handle it.

A few weeks later, more needles were found on the floor in a room. Another staff member confronted my boss about conducting safety training immediately, but he delayed it for over a month, citing how busy he was.

As a patient, I share information with my healthcare providers to ensure my safety, including the fact that I engage in sex work and receive counseling on this topic. During an appointment, I mentioned considering returning to sex work. My doctor/boss shared that he and his wife attended an erotic festival and showed me a picture of himself surrounded by realistic-looking dildos. He told me I needed to understand all sex terms and recommended a website, offering me his login information, which made me uncomfortable. I decided not to use his account due to privacy concerns and discomfort. The website focused on female orgasm, and he changed the password to something along the lines of “don’thavetoomuchfun”, which added to my discomfort. This recommendation, along with his login details, was documented in my after-visit summary which I have screenshots of.

In a moment of crisis, his staff provided his personal cellphone number as a contact for emergencies, which also made me uncomfortable. The clinic had other issues, such as me having to advocate for a coworker to get paid on time, illegal charges for filling out FMLA forms, and patients not receiving the care promised in their memberships.

He prescribed me an antipsychotic medication that I had a severe allergic reaction to, causing hives, anxiety, and difficulty breathing. Despite visible scratches from itching, he refused to take me off the medication, claiming he wanted stability in my life and finances. Another doctor at the clinic advised that I shouldn't be on the medication and that he was keeping me on it to prevent me from calling out of work due to the difficult tapering process.

All these issues have caused extreme emotional distress and worsened my depression. When I raised the issue of tapering off the medication, he immediately refused. Other clinic staff are aware of issues that need reporting but avoid doing so due to concerns about income and reputation. This situation has caused me severe anxiety, and I want to quit but cannot afford to. Does anyone know of any legal action I can take, or if I would qualify for unemployment if I quit? "

Its starting to effect me physically.

Hi, Im currently working as an electrical engineer (26M) in manufacturing, my working hrs are not extreme. The normal 830-530 Monday to Friday. A lot of issues happens in my personal life and working life and it has effected my mental health. Ive been in the company for 2 years. I was doing great at work for the first 6 months, I pushed hard to get recognition and I got it, I was to become the lead after 6 months in the company. But I think I overdid it. The months following the news, I kept pushing through amy work keeps getting added, people expect more from me, people find me for solutions, now Im getting disturbed every 30 minutes with other people shit, I cant complete my stuff. Im getting thrown around in between 2  departments.

 They want me to start doing stuff for the new department when Im already filled to the brim in my original department. I spoke to my boss twice during these time, he told me to slow down and prioritize, he said he will reduce my work load and all. I try to slow down and prioritize only to get more work and at such short notice. The real killer is the unrealistic expectations of clients and what ever they say is judgment, always gave threats of stopping the tender to our companies and made us feel like idiots during inspection, cuz everything is hand made, but they expect it to be perfect. So much harsh words and threatening remarks all the time.

I recently went to a psychiatrist told my issues and got prescribed medication, I had a history of anxiety disorder but it was manageable, but not anymore. The medication helps a lot but i cant continue to work here anymore. I cant sleep well anymore, Im vomiting every morning from the anxiety. I tremble sometimes. My head hurts. Im done. I wanna quit without a job lined up, I want to rest and recharge. I have enough savings to do so. FMLA doesnt exist in my country. The 2 months notice period holds me back from getting another job cuz its too long. So I need to quit to find a job.

What do I do, therapy isnt helping much. The meds are working well to muffle the anxiety but makes me feel robotic. I need some advice, am I just lazy or whiny. I cant tell between burn out and just lazy or tired. I dont know whats right or wrong anymore. I dont know what I can do or cant do anymore. I need some advice please. I should have left earlier, I kept pushing it back and sucked it up for too long."

I am at the point where I am owed another 2k, and I am tired of working for free. I work with clients who depend on me to get their contracts set up and I feel awful for leaving them high and dry.

This is really to vent and kind of get advice to figure out what to do in this situation. This position is remote and flexible enough to where I can take care of my kids while working which is why I have stayed so long. I am planning on sending an email to my boss to explain that I will no longer be working for free but I have also thought about just doing.. nothing, and waiting for them to catch on and fire me.

And then my general manager placed me as a  supporting site inspectior (which is the Project Team's job) to make a man made river which is located inside the project just to coordinate the contractors how to place the stone aesthetically. I accepted this temporary placement as a one time thing.

And then my general manager asked me to do site supervision for the whole project, which includes the river and the rest of the project. I wanted to decline, i was afraid of getting fired because when they sent me to this position i was just 4 months in the job. 

Fast forward a year, the general manager quit, and now the senior VP handles me. Now i am a drafter with the same salary. And i am doing site supervision for the whole project. Which includes a lot of new responsibilities such as :

1. Managing a plant nursery
2. Managing labour creating schedule for their daily tasks
3. Doing survey for plant hunting because this company is too poor to buy plants for projects. (Though this company is corporate and has one of the biggest collaborator on an international level)

No longer doing my original responsibility and i am basically doing a job above my paygrade

My pay for a month in USD is only 400$ and the standard grade for the job that im doing is in the range of 800$ - 1000$

I am incredibly depressed because of this job because the senior VP directly handling things and keeps asking me for results. 

He promises me to upgrade my position as a supervisor but it has been 4 months since he promised my promotion and i doubt it will ever happen.

I want to quit but my parents dont have a retirement plan and depends on me and my sister to spare 200$ of my 400$ salary for monthly expenses. And i live in their house because houses or rent arent cheap. Been looking for a new job but its so hard to find a new job it has been 4 months.

Im just so depressed from all of this"

We have all complained about her in the employee surveys and that team has even went to hr yet we are told if we don’t like her management style we can leave. Sad part is that she use to work on the floor and we all loved her. Now that she is part of management, it’s like her whole personality shifted and she doesn’t care about us at all. I even filed compliant through the ethics line because she told me that I should’ve just left my child in daycare when I called to inform her I’m taking her to the dr because the daycare said she had hand foot and mouth. This woman has six children. Her newest bull shit was her sending an email stating our time will be adjusted or she will tell us to go home once we reach overtime. I had 3 minutes of overtime and she called me friday to say she was clocking me out earlier because I was in overtime. I know adjusting people’s time card is illegal but at the same time I also know her petty self would find a way to write me up or find an excuse to get rid of me if i complained to our ethics line.

So extremely physical is extremely rough and I shouldn't be doing it.

I found a job that was listed as very low impact/physical stress and it was in the family of my preferred field, and I was very excited. I interviewed, got offered a job contingent upon a drug screen and physical. Great, no problem. Even with my health issues, I've never had an issue passing a simple physical.

Not the case in this instance. This low impact/no lifting job required a physical that had me doing 50 squats (with a blown out knee), and lifting a 65 pound bag up onto a shift that was nearly at level with the top of my head (I'm 5'6"").

I did not pass that physical, and the job offer will most likely be retracted within the next couple of days because they were insistent that I had to pass before being hired. Now I can see why this place is constantly hiring desperately, that's for sure. It's like a job requiring 10 years experience for something that's only been around for the last 2 years."

Since I started this job I’ve been working overtime only. My boss likes to include the hours into my schedule as if I’m supposed to work the extra hours. My contract said that I’ll work 78 hours a month but I work 120 hours now. I tried to convince myself by saying that I need the money for uni but this job is taking a toll on me bc my boss wants me to work even more hours. Yesterday I went out and when I came back home I was extremely exhausted. I managed to wake up for my morning shift but I had no energy and felt pretty sick. I messaged my boss saying that I couldn’t come 20 minutes before the time and I also called but no one picked. 

The thing is that there are only two workers in the morning ( me and my boss in this case) and I did feel guilty for leaving him alone but then I realised that I hit 78 hours last week Friday and that the remaining work is just overtime. Almost everyone has quit this job bc it’s shitty and they have no respect for their workers. My boss thought it was okay to argue with my former co worker (and friend) til 3 am. I’m not joking. He can’t address situations like a real boss and always uses our what’s app chat group to sneak diss our workers. I also want to quitt but uni is starting in October which means that I’ll only work there til September. I realised that it wouldn’t make much sense to work at another place for one month. I think I can survive but I hate it here. The customers are racist (I’m black) and I have to suck it in but I’ve told myself that I’m not going to do that no more. My boss always expects us to work. I already work for everyone and he still had the audacity to ask me to work on Monday last week. I didn’t read the message until a few days later bc that was my free day and I didn’t want to risk it. 

I’m also not super mentally fit rn bc I’m dealing with a lot and I just want to stay home tomorrow and just rest. I’m tired."

1175,2024-07-22,My wife gave up her life to work in worse conditions in America,u/espressoBump,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e9cbhf/my_wife_gave_up_her_life_to_work_in_worse/,antiwork,"My wife is South Korean and moved to the US so we could stay together easily.

 By moving to the US in 2021 she gave up her career as a front-end web developer and has not been able to find a similar position since. Now she works at a warehouse so we can make ends meet, and has given up on her former career.

 I blame American companies because  they offshore and cut expenses so that everyone is tight on resources. Even in my company we had two backend developers design some of our web pages because we ""couldn't afford"" the UI/UX designers. The CEO of one of our companies makes 400k a year. The developers are offshore from India - you know we can afford it. 

 It's been 3 years she has not worked in a relevant field and only had 2 years experience so that dream is pretty much dead. Especially with all of the budget cuts in tech. This hardly makes it the land of opportunity. And now, she's moving heavy boxes.

My wife took the first seasonal job available to her last year because we were having trouble on my one salary alone after 2 years. This led her into being a full-time employee at a warehouse, and it's run so poorly. They do not schedule two consecutive days off, shifts start at 3-4 am, and people keep quitting because they're being pushed to the limit. The majority of senior team members have left for the military as a way to get out. The older senior folks who have no other options are popping ibuprofen every day because they're in pain. 

They're whipping them like slaves, and forcing them to go beyond protocol standards with limited resources and people. So for example, a standard cart takes 10 boxes and can be emptied in 20 minutes. They're given 25 boxes and expected to unload it in the same amount of time, and get yelled at when it's not done. They also, scheduled their lunch so late in the day that it's extremely difficult to take their last 15 minute break, because when one comes back from their 30 minute lunch they have 15 minutes to take their break. Most people want to finish their work and forgo the last 15 minutes.

This is truly, the American experience. We don't have a yatch or a business and aren't making bank so it's hard to justify living here. We were able afford putting money down on a home with the death of a close relative, and the expenses and hassle of everything is so much harder than in Korea. I'm surprised we don't have insurance to cover our insurance, because on every turn it seems like America is greedy and trying to short change you.

On the one hand, I want to be grateful for this opportunity that other people my age don't have (home ownership), but when I see my wife in pain I ask myself is it worth it? Not to mention, she comes home physically exhausted so I'm doing all of the yardwork, and atleast 50% of the cleaning. We stopped having sit down meals, because we don't have the time on her schedule. And we're *not* having kids. So I look out at a yard after landscaping on my own and I feel like what's the point? Ain't nobody playing in it.

The last thing I need to mention is how warped my family is on working. One asshole told my wife to work at a nail salon, because that's what Koreans do. One family member worked outrageous hours with minimal sleep, got ""rescued"" (she was abused) and changed her life around at 45. To her, it's like, if I did it so can you. My mother and father believe God will find a way so you need to just listen and make the right choices in these opportunities (the warehouse). 

The icing on the cake is the relative who died duped us, and insulted us before giving us any money. We put the house in our name and he said he wouldn't give us the down payment unless she was off it. He blamed me for  spending my money recklessly and insulted the other side of my family for being like them and bad with money. He requested her father match what he puts on the house then she can have her name on it. ""Why don't they pay up instead of talking that goo-goo-ga-ga"" language"". This man was an immigrant himself. 

I give my wife so much credit. She's an amazing person, and an extremely strong woman - mentally and physically. I love her so much and want what's best for her. This life is NOT it. I need to do whatever I can to help her. And if we move back to Korea, it'll be obvious why."

Instead of 1 or 2 people per job, 4 to 5 people could be hired instead. Each work a maximum of 5 to 6 hours a shift and no more than 4 or 5 days a week. This way more people are employed, and the unemployment rate is reduced. More people are available to cover for those who are off sick or on leave, also allowing more time for workers to recoup, reducing stress and burnout, and allowing more time with family.

Traffic is reduced because everyone's shift differs and the roads aren't as saturated. 

Everyone has the opportunity to go shopping when they need and not just wait for weekends. 

Because companies are open for longer hours, their business/sales doesn't reduce, in fact might increase and therefore they can pay their staff. 

Weekends are eradicated, and instead every company, by law has to have two days a week where they close and no one comes in or tends to work related things. The two days can be consecutive or random, and can change each month. 

Everyone's natural sleep cycle is different; some prefer to be productive at night and those people can opt for either late night chores, or late night jobs while allowing their natural sleep cycles to still be healthy. 



Here's the thing, the concept of work is archaic - people are burnt out, depressed, overworked and still cannot afford to buy houses, cars, or even afford time with their families. Something has to change. Businesses should be about allowing a community to function smoothly, not about profit and money (the big corp greedy bastards) "

Manager was fifteen minutes late for our 1 to 1. First thing he asks is ""how's your time management been recently?"" I'm like... ""erm, I think it's been ok?"", when he goes ""I was told you came in an hour early last week when you didn't need to."" For background, most of our team start at 9, but me and a couple of others are outdoors staff and get in at 8am or earlier for at least some days every week. I'd needed to drop some paperwork off that day, by 8:30, so I'd intended on being in for 8am. My alarm didn't go off, so I text my other manager who I was with that day to tell him I was going to be slightly late (I got in at 8:07), as I assumed, because we were doing outdoorsy stuff, we'd start at 8. I didn't realise he had booked us in for 9, so we had a short, friendly convo about it over text, then he got in late himself at 9:20. 

Now I'm having special talks about how I need to ""check your calendar in the morning or the night before, just so you don't put anybody out"". Like, I didn't put anybody out, it was me that was kept waiting after 9am? I'd set everything up for us in that time so we could just jump in a truck and go, no faffing around.

He was literally 45mins late to our last 1 to 1 and I didn't say anything. Feel like I'm being unfairly scrutinised over stuff that isn't important. He's a manager making over 40k in his mid twenties, still lives with his parents. It's his first time being a manager. Everyone I speak to sings his praises.

Ive seen more and more evidence of the workforce getting closer to a breaking point, and i wonder how many everyday Americans are looking for another option.   
  
Something like a general strike takes a lot of planning, effort and community, but there are so many groups out there building support groups and networks of mutual aid, i truly feel we are well on our way to something that may take years, but is absolutely achievable. Thoughts?"
54,2024-07-22,Boss wants us to attend a funeral as a team,u/CautiousThought365,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e9ftum/boss_wants_us_to_attend_a_funeral_as_a_team/,antiwork,"I'm in an uncomfortable situation but I'm holding my ground and I feel mostly confident with my stance. Would love some feedback though!

Background: My company is made of a small staff including an executive director and we are guided by a board of directors. We have a family that's been very important in my company and it's basic knowledge that they founded the company from the beginning and have been in stride with it as we have grown and expanded over 60 years.  Usually nothing of importance happens at the company without this family's involvement and/or say-so.  Only one family member (grandson) is on the board of directors but a couple of other members are still involved.  

Last week myself, my boss, and some of the important family members (the son and grandson) were at a conference out of town.  The son and grandson knew of the matriarch's condition and even took several days off out of town at the resort where our conference took place.  Come Friday, the matriarch passed away.  On Saturday our company put out an email to our entire membership about the loss of this woman and shared her service information. 

Later Saturday evening, a group text went out to staff from our boss about closing the office early Monday (today) to attend the service as a team.  Some coworkers responded quickly agreeing with the idea, but I didn't respond.  

One: I have an prior obligation- a city community board that I chair is meeting and I never miss this. Two: I don't feel comfortable attending a funeral performatively because the person who passed away is work adjacent.  Grieving is different for everyone.  To me a funeral is a solemn ceremony meant for family and loved ones. I don't feel that I belong at this funeral, even to support our board member who is the grandson of the deceased. I feel a card and online memento is enough to share my condolences.

On Sunday, my boss texted me and one other coworker aside of the group chat because he wanted to make sure we saw the group chat and wanted a response.  The other coworker said they would attend but I spoke up and said I have a prior obligation.  This triggered my boss to text me alone and ask if it is something I can miss.  I go on to tell him that it isn't just that I have my prior obligation, I also don't feel comfortable attending the funeral.  He didn't say anything after that, just went silent.

I'm here at the office today (Monday) and he hasn't said anything to me yet.  I'm a little worried I may have caused trouble for myself.

Since then, I've been working in a warehouse packing and moving boxes. Every single time I interview for an entry-level marketing job, the employer inevitably asks, ""Why are you working in a warehouse?"" Seriously? As if it's some great mystery. The alternative they propose? Working for free as an unpaid intern to ""gain experience.""

Do they not understand that I need to put a roof over my head and food on the table? How am I supposed to survive on experience alone? It's like they don't see the full picture. I'm tired of explaining that survival jobs are called that for a reason—they help us survive while we keep chasing our dreams.

It's infuriating that they don't get it. Not everyone has the luxury of living off savings or having someone else foot the bill while they work for free. We take these jobs out of necessity, not choice. The lack of empathy and understanding from employers is mind-blowing. Maybe try walking in our shoes for a day and see how it feels to juggle survival with aspirations."

So, the work is with cable crimping rj45 & Keystone punching. the boss charges more than a $1 + labour + hour took to work from Client. as its over time my expectation is getting double payment or pay me best on how many i do. 

monthly pay is $215. he paid $5.98 as he says. i work 10am to 6:30pm and makes us work overtime so i made up guts and asked and that's the response i got. using me and my friend he made $239 in just 2 days and in many other sites same. 

after another stupid reply of his will pay best I packed the bag and left. 

the salary is not worth it even if i take that $5.98  i needed to have lunch to do the hard labour work. food cost is $5.38 total for me and my friend together we do contro, it just didn't seem worth so left. tomorrow he going to give lecture.

Frankly, I don't care what people choose to believe so long is they don't try to impose those beliefs on me.  I don't see this as having any place in the workplace. 

However, this person (VERY high up in the food chain) keeps sending emails to all of my team with links to tweets or TikToks of these theories.  They sent one last week and I decided to pull the thread a bit.  So I looked at the other content posted by the OP and it was full of racist and misogynistic stuff (say nothing about a whole lot of disinformation).  It was pretty offensive. 

I decided to reach out to a friend of mine who is a peer of his to share my concern.  The peer pulled him aside and told him that he needed to stop, which he allegedly agreed to. 

Well, not 48 hours later and he is back to his same behavior.  He just couldn't help himself I guess.  

My concern is that this is toxic and could be perceived as harassing behavior.  It is not creating an environment I want to work in.  And I also feel like it opens the company up to potential lawsuits or something for hostile work environments. 

Am I wrong?  How would you handle this?  I am thinking I am going to quit because this guy just can't seem to control himself.  Curious for your takes."

He's a tech writer with decades of experience; his last contract just ended so he's being headhunted and is actively searching.  An agency contacted him with a long-term contract temp-to-perm tech writer job that was very similar to what he had been doing for the last 8 months, even in the same industry.  Before his remote interview with the potential employer, the agency set up a Zoom with him to talk about job; they later thanked him for showing up in business attire and paying full attention to the screen, which apparently isn't the norm anymore.  The next day was the meeting with the director, for which they emailed him the link.  He clicked into the meeting ""waiting room,"" but no one ever invited him into the meeting!  He sat there for half an hour waiting, and even called the dial-in number, but there was no one else there.   

Of course he contacted the agency, who said they had no idea what happened but they'd get in touch with the company.  According to the agency, the company didn't respond to their calls or emails and basically ghosted them.  We figured they'd filled the position, but why be so shitty?

Then early last week, the agency got back in touch and said the company had reached out to them (without apology or explanation) and wanted to reschedule my husband's interview for last Friday.  \[Translation: Shitty & Co. had their offer fall through, and now they're scrambling.\]  About 90 minutes before the scheduled time, they said they had to reschedule for today (Monday).  Again, no explanation.   My husband agreed, but said it had to be in the morning as he's going out of state for a week. 

Well, it should come as no surprise that yet again, this morning's interview never happened.  The agency claimed that they were again ghosted by the company, who never sent them the interview link or provided any explanation or apology.  

WTF.  So now I'm driving him up to guitar camp for a week, and I told him not even to take his laptop or give these jerks another thought.  "

So happy, I hate working in a warehouse house environment. I’ve been passed up so many times for supervisor positions and better positions than I have now because of nepotism and “seniority.” 

Applied for a supervisor position once at an old job, got rejected because “my personal life is to chaotic.” Whatever that meant only to find out that it’s illegal. Girl they hired was a supervisors daughter. She called in like everyday, showed up late, then just no call no showed. I never called in, showed ambition to learn, and minded my own business.

Applied for a position to drive a forklift on a the receiving dock recently. Got turned down because someone had more seniority than me at the job. Only for them to transfer and my manager to say, “here you go you can sign this.” Got the position and now they have no one to cover my days off since everyone transferred to the newly built warehouse. The only guy who can cover my days off calls in or last minute says “I’m not gonna make it, I have volunteer work.” Really it’s to party with the people from this group. Managers are being so lenient to not get him fired. He’s always late to work making excuses like, “I can’t find my keys.” Really he overslept from getting to fucked up the night before. It’s 1.5x pay Sundays and they took mine to give to him because “it’s the only day they have enough coverage to give me a day off.” Bullshit, they know it’s the only day he’ll show up so they give it to him. They’ve even switched my days off to cover for him and made me work the shift he’s calling out for. I’ve even typed out a letter to send to corporate.

I know no job will ever be perfect, but I can’t wait to start working in Physical Therapy and be done with these bullshit jobs. I’m so glad I didn’t want to trap myself in this terrible warehouse nepotistic environment. I’m not saying it won’t be perfect, but it has to be better than these companies that claim they’re gonna help you or that “we’re a family.” 

So glad I’m almost done, so fucking glad. I’m counting days at this point. "

10,2024-07-22,They are introducing me as the new Executive Director but I haven't signed a contract ,u/Danlrap18,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1e9jkkz/they_are_introducing_me_as_the_new_executive/,antiwork,"So about 3 weeks ago my boss, the Executive Director, quit. About a week later the board decided to offer me the Interim Executive Director job. The terms of the offer were basically doing 2 people's job (the Executive Director role and my current role) for basically the same pay, so I declined. After that, the board president had a chat with me which went horribly wrong. I honestly dislike the president, I consider myself a hard worker because I am motivated to perform and achieve my objectives. I sometimes work more than 40 hours if I need to. Not always, just when we have a busy season and I get satisfaction from showing off my numbers. So when I read the job description I told the president that there was no way, knowing how many hours I currently work on my role, to juggle 2 people's responsibilities. I asked for more money and he said no because I was not expected to work more than 40 hours a week, I had no experience as Executive Director, and I would not be held to the high standard a full-time Executive Director would. 

I asked him to change some things in the offer to make the role manageable with extra budget to hire contractors to cover my current role and a slight raise because I will be managing more people. He agreed to it so I informally accepted but was very cleared that I wanted those changes on paper before making everything official.

The offered states that my first day was supposed to be 2 days ago so I reached out to the Board President 3 days ago to ask about the contract since I haven't received anything yet, but I haven't heard anything. Meanwhile I can see the former Executive Director already shared all the necessary documents,  introduced me to all the contractors, stakeholders and donors via email, and transfered all the accounts to my name. 

Last week another key member of our team quit, which leaves 2 roles vacant. Tomorrow we have our annual planning and as the Interim Executive Director I am expected to solve the issue of being short 2 people and the board not wanting to fill any of those roles until a full-time Executive Director is hired, which according to the board will take them between 3 to 6 months.

I am extremely annoyed by how ridiculous their demands for this new role is with 2 staff members gone. I am also annoyed by the lack of communication and the fact that they are moving forward introducing me as the new Executive Director whithout having formalize the contract. But what is really bothering me is that the president, during one of our conversations, said having grit was not a good quality to have, that I should not grind and just stick to my 40 hours a week. This statement really angered me. I come from a place where my entire culture is about working hard. They wouldn't have looked at me to fill in the role if I wasn't able to perform and have great results. I am the highest performing employee because I work hard and this dumbass is telling me that is not a good quality to have. Not to mention the slap on the face of not making me full-time Executive Director, not even giving me the chance to interview for the role and expecting me to put out the massive fire they've created.

That really soured the relationship for me. I am not motivated at all to do this job anymore. I don't want to do any of it until a contract is signed and after that I am taking my extra pay, only work 40 hours a week no matter how bad things get, and start looking for a new job right away. With that kind of leadership, no wonder why everyone is jumping ship."

I have been working at the same company for almost 4 years. I have been in this role for almost 2.

I was told in May I was ready for a promotion and I would be recommended for the next promotion cycle in August. I was happy! It felt like my work was being appreciated and that I was an asset to my team.

Well, a few weeks later they said ""nevermind, but we can guide you to be promoted in December."" Fuck that. You think I am going to wait another 6 months? Do you think I'll work my ass off for 6 months just for you to tell me the same shit again in December? No.

I asked them what changed their mind and apparently, while I was doing an engineering apprenticeship (which I assumed would have given me a leg up in the promotion cycle...) the mentor I had NEVER gave me direct feedback. Sure, she told me what I needed to work on and I made an effort to, but she never updated me on my progress. Instead she went straight to my boss to basically explain ""shes not ready yet."" How can a person that has no managerial experience decide my career path like that? I assumed that if I took on extra work FOR FREE (my fucking mistake) then that would prove to my team that I am an asset, I am intelligent, and I am helpful. Nope. It ended up biting me in the ass and instead I was denied the promotion. These were their reasons.  
1) My troubleshooting methods were ""chaotic."" Okay, 1, fuck you. I have ADHD and my brain works differently than yours. At the end of the day, I get the same damn results. This is not high school algebra where the teacher expects me to ""show my work"" exactly like they do or I get points deducted if I dont.  
2) Doesn't ask enough questions. Okay fuck you again. I specifically did not ask my mentor questions because every time I DID they were like ""sorry, can we schedule a meeting for 2 days from now? my bandwidth is limited."" So INSTEAD I went directly to my team to get these questions answered because I am not waiting 2 fucking days for you to free up.   
3) She works too fast - this one was fine. I have been told in most aspects of my life to ""slow down"" but this shit blind sided me and it's as if the effort I HAVE put in to SLOW DOWN has been ignored. I started slowing down even more by taking on less of a workload. If my boss asks me why I am not taking on as many cases, my response from now on is ""I have taken the advice of my managers to slow down my work and really focus on the detail - so I am limited in the amount of cases I can take per day.

I told my manager, professionally, most of this is horseshit and the engineer is unprofessional and shitty to not directly give me ANY of this information. Since then, my managers and I have been working on a career plan - fine. Wish that was already fucking a thing before this shit show but whatever.

Well, I got my peer review from my boss today. Out of a score of 5 they gave me a 3 ""meets expectations."" Get. Fucked. I have put in so much extra work, time, energy and extra help to get a promotion but the fact that they refuse to see ANY of the progress I've made, the work I've done, the achievements I've received (and extra certifications) just to chalk my entire career up to ""eh, she works too fast. Not good enough"" makes me want to set the world on fire. Taking on extra work for FREE should not be an expectation of me. I did the apprenticeship to further my learning AND help my team AND take some of the burden off the engineers.

But no, it ended up completely fucking me, and the person getting the promotion instead has been with the company less time than I have, didn't do the apprenticeship, AND....is a man (I am a woman).

I have a meeting with my manager tomorrow about the peer review and I need to come up with a few (professional) things to say about how all of this is complete bullshit. "

I got covid because I work in a hospital setting, so I'm at higher risk for this stuff. My employer makes you miss 7 full days of work. That's 56 hours of PTO.

I decided I wasn't going to just throw away all of the PTO away. I spent so much time accumulating the small amount that I do have. Call me an ass. Call me whatever you'd like. I went into work acting completely normal and not a single soul knew I had covid, even though I was suffering in the inside.

No raises from 2020-2023 for anyone. It was announced in Summer 2023 that all employees would receive a 5% raise.

Soon after this announcement the company closed their satellite location I was working in. They laid off all of the staff but offered a few of us jobs at other offices that were very far away. I reluctantly accepted and went at work at another location doing the same job.

My 5% raise was supposed to be effective 8/2024 but never made it into my paycheck. I gave it a few pay periods and notified HR in September 2024.

I was told I did not qualify as I was a “new hire.” I explained that I have been working for the organization for 5 years and that my office was closed, and I signed a new contract when I transferred to the new location. 

Then then gave me an internal HR memo stating anyone that “accepted a new position with pay increase” was not eligible for the raise. It was a $700 increase due to locality change in pay rate. The 5% raise would have been for 5 times that.

I go to the CEO and explain the above situation. He agrees this is an extenuating circumstance and the raise should go through and sends it to “central HR."" 

I email the central HR for monthly updates  and am told in July 2024 that the raise will not go through despite our CEO and board of directors saying to do so for the same reasons first mentioned.

I have it in an email saying they will give me the raise. It  was also brought up in an official meeting and there is minutes from the meeting.  

I have tried to resolve the issue at all levels of the organization.

I am considering filing a wage claim with the department of labor in my state but have not done so before. Any advice on whether this complaint would be considered is greatly appreciated. I emailed the DOL and called for advice but just keep getting a generalized email.

Last week I went to a check up where the workers comp doctor began insisting I’m going back to work immediately. I was informed my company called and they insisted they lift my restrictions that say I can’t work. I felt completely backed into a corner and now I’m incredibly stressed about going back. I don’t feel ready. I’m still in a ton of pain, my bones are still broken, and mentally this accident took its toll on me. Management is apparently not allowed to speak to me and nobody has once checked on me besides coworkers who aren’t in management.

I wasn't always remote. I became remote in 2019 after it was found that I was being stalked by a security contract employee without any direction from a supervisor. 

Working from home solved so many of my mental health issues and I became extremely productive. When the company shut down I was absolutely heartbroken. 

I got a new job in March 2024. This job seemed like the perfect stepping stone from my last one (went from a full stack dev to tech lead). This job is contract (fml) and hybrid (2 days/week). At first I was fine going into the office until I started noticing similar behaviors from my coworkers. They started asking me where I was or where I was going. One even followed me on my vape break and when I asked him if he needed anything he said no and walked back inside. They even message me on Teams if I am away for more than 3 minutes asking where I am. Whenever I ask if they need anything, they say they are ""checking in"". 

I brought this up to my boss and politely asked him if he was having my coworkers keep tabs on me. I wouldn't mind if he did, I would just like to know. He said he did not ask the team to do anything like that. So, now I wake up every Monday and Tuesday with a panic attack. 

This, sadly, isn't even the biggest issue I have with this job. These same coworkers also refuse to treat me as a tech lead or respect my skills that I was hired to help teach them. I've been specifically called out by name in meetings asking if I ""understand the material"" to make me seem dumb, I've been called a dev multiple times instead of my actual title, and I've been mostly treated as a note taker/admin. 

I'm already looking around for a new job but I'm seriously struggling with these in-office days. I brought this up to my recruiter and he told me to just deal with it. 

Do you have existential dread going into the office? How do you deal with it?

But what about those of us who don't get any of that? At my current job I'm significantly younger than anyone else here (I'm 28 so not even that young) and when I started, I tried to be easygoing and sometimes make little jokes in my emails or messages because that was the environment at my last job. It was one of the things I actually liked, being able to show snippets of who I actually am at work. (i.e. occasional gifs, maybe references to something ironic at work, etc)

I quickly realized that most of the time this was not reciprocated at my current job and may actually annoy people, so it's kind of all professional all the time. And I'm not the type of person who is even particularly friendly with coworkers, it's more like that was one of the only ways I knew how to connect with people before. I'm a lot better at expressing myself through writing. Idk, it just feels so serious here. For example I got excited about planning an event and sent a happy message to a coworker with some more ideas and said this is going to be the best [company] event ever, and they just....never replied to that message 😕 it's a real bummer tbh, spending 40 hours per week in a team that doesn't really...have fun together, at least that I'm involved in.

I’ve been at my current job for 2 years. I was hired as primarily remote and wasn’t required to go into the office for the first 6 months. The company was also aware that I was 3 hours away from the office when hiring me. After 6 months I was required to make a trip up to the office once a month (this was often very unproductive). 6 months ago I was planning on relocating to a different state and they made a big deal about me moving saying I would have to expense my flight into the office once a month. I agreed and called their bluff and only went into the office once. At this point they are trying to force the issue again on me. I haven’t had a salary renegotiation since I started at this job and only a 3 percent raise since starting after 6 months. I think this is absolutely ridiculous considering I’ve continued taking on more responsibility with no pay and they want me to basically burn money just to sit in an office for a job I can do remotely. What are my options here? Is it time to find a new job? Remote work has been so much better for my mental health and the primary reason I’ve stuck around.

My job I can easily do remotely (and even did for 2+ months after major surgery) and we have someone else who works fully remote (in the same state I'm about to move to). 

I've been here almost 5 years, this is my first ""real"" job. Out of nowhere they've been just taking out a bunch of anger and aggression on me. They don't communicate well and expect me to always ask questions about everything all of a sudden (I'll admit my communication isn't the best at times, but I've never been told besides one time that it was an issue- I've tried to fix it and made more of an effort in that sense). They've been asking me ""where is XYZ?"" at meetings when I was never told to do XYZ, but I was suddenly expected to have it right there. I've literally shown them some of the work I've done, asked if it was ok, then only at our one on ones get told that something is wrong with it, why would I do that, etc. My job doesn't really have deadlines, nothing I do is super urgent. I don't understand why all of a sudden I'm expected to be rushing to do this work otherwise I'm told I'm ""too slow"" when it's never been an issue before how I do my work. 

I'm getting very frustrated and overwhelmed. I mentioned I was moving a couple months ago and they said they'd think about me being fully remote. At this point I genuinely do not want to work for them anymore but it hurts feeling like I'm going to get fired when I'm literally trying to do what they said to do more of. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong at this point. 

Every year before I was always told I do great work, great raises, chill job, etc etc etc. going as recent as a couple months ago even. I was told a couple months ago that they were even looking to promote me further (of course that hasn't happened). 

I've been looking off and on for other jobs and thankfully I have plenty saved regardless of what happens (moving in with family and won't have as many bills). 

Is there anything I should do to better prepare? At this point I could go either way. "

For the hours that I was not billable, I filed those as overhead hours for continued education. However, this morning I was contacted by a manager requesting that I take that overhead time and instead file it as ""vacation"" time. I refused, stating that I was in the office or working from home at the time and that I would not be willing to burn my earned vacation time while I was in my work environment either studying or requesting something to work on.

Usually it's in September, but this year I'm pregnant and can't fly past the middle of August, so I'm going to first week of August. 

I plan and pay for my vacations in advance. I usually do both in the spring, and have them paid off in or by May. I get cheaper tickets for planes and hotels so I always plan and pay in advance and let my work supervisors know months in advance. 

This year I let my supervisor know in early May of my vacation in August, giving them 3 months advance. I have the time to take this vacation. The vacation is already paid for. And everything is ready to go. 

My boss is saying she told us not to plan or pay for vacations in advance. She wants us to I guess pay or plan it last minute when we know we won't get that time off. She's saying we could lose the money by her denying us off that time despite months in advance notice.

My question is, can my boss legally tell me that I can't plan or pay for my vacations ahead of time? While I know they can deny my vacation time, which I'm still going on my vacation anyway, I'll just get a sick note, can they tell me how and when to spend my money?"

The thing is, I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is burnout or if I'm just bored out of my mind. Here's a bit of context:

1. **Role and Responsibilities:** My job involves a lot of administrative tasks, patient interactions, and coordination. While I enjoy the patient interaction aspect, the repetitive nature of the tasks is starting to get to me. I feel like I'm doing the same thing day in and day out without much variation.
2. **Work Environment:** My work environment isn't particularly noisy, which is something I appreciate because I hate noise and screaming kids. However, it's also not very stimulating. I often find myself feeling mentally checked out, even though the workload itself isn't overwhelming.
3. **Professional Interests:** I have a background in healthcare administration with a focus on health services analysis. I love diving deep into problems, researching solutions, and improving processes, but I don't want a role where I'm crunching numbers all day. I also prefer not to manage people or work in overly noisy environments.
4. **Career Aspirations:** Ideally, I'd like to move into a role that's more aligned with health policy analysis, health services research, or something related to patient experience. I recently applied for an Industrial Hygienist position at my workplace and I'm waiting to hear back.
5. **Interactions with Colleagues:** I have a coworker, Danielle, who I enjoy interacting with. We sometimes share light moments, which makes the workday a bit more pleasant, but those moments are few and far between.

Given this context, I'm trying to figure out if I'm burned out or just bored out. Here are some specific questions for you all:

* How do you differentiate between burnout and being bored out in a job?
* Have any of you experienced something similar, and if so, how did you deal with it?
* Would a role change within the same company potentially help, or should I consider looking for opportunities elsewhere?
* Any advice on how to make my current job more engaging if switching roles isn't an immediate option?

Thanks in advance for your insights!"

Yeah I know it was you..” first off she mentioned it hours later but it was how she called me out as per usual in her rude bossy tone. I finally stood up for myself and told her that I’m her same position and that I would appreciate if she stops ordering me and bossing me around and that I’m always willing to help if she needs. She then proceeds to yell at me in front of everyone for ten minutes and tell me “how her tone is fine” “how my feelings don’t matter bc I’m wrong” “have I ever had a job before” “I have a problem with authority” “she talks to everyone like this” etc I was so disrespected and shocked and not one of my coworkers stood up for me.

Worked here for 2 and a half years (office job in medical field) , I’m under 24 - I have a relatively okay support system, savings, and side hustle.

It seems like since we’ve voiced our concerns things have gotten worse… and shady to say the least. It’s like it’s being swept under the rug and we’ve been left in the dark since despite following up, but there are clear signs.

I’ve been lurking on this sub for a few months now, but my general anti-work sentiment started a long time ago. Basically, what I am getting from this sub is that I have been EXTRMELY lucky to be in the position that I am in. 

I am college educated, went to a private uni on academic scholarships, and now have a job in interior design with decent pay - not to mention in the same neighborhood, so I don’t even have to drive to the place. It’s a really good situation, objectively. 

The only thing is, I’m already burnt out. In fact, I have felt continuously burnt out since high school when the whole rat race started. (The SAT prep actually started in middle school). I went through a really bad depression during my senior year of high school because I was so involved, the perfect student, worked my ASS off, and for what? I knew that in 4 years I would be sitting back at a desk for 8 hours a day, just like I was at school. Except I would be an adult, with real responsibilities. If that’s my future, I did not want to live. 

That was about 7 years ago, and not much has changed about my perspective. In college, I learned all about the generational gap in wealth in my sociology classes. I learned how much easier it was for people not even 20 years ago to find jobs, to own property, to buy a car, to have children, to go on an overseas trip or have a wedding. I realized, with not much surprise, that the reality I am facing is much, much worse than how I had pictured it in my younger years, and the things that actually make life meaningful are far out of reach. The only thing I can reach right now is a decent paying job.

And with that job, my mental health is slightly better, other than the general (sometimes overwhelming) sense of hopelessness. My day to day is so monotonous and I don’t know why I’m drained all the time but I am. Then, I get reminded from my older peers in person and online that yes, their job is shitty & boring too (often more than mine). I guess I have nothing to look forward to, other than increased pay.

So Reddit, I guess I’m asking for some advice or encouragement to get through whatever this quarter life crisis is, and maybe some solitude that others are experiencing it too. 

I just keep getting told that I’m way too young to lose hope. So why am I feeling this way?

I recently took a teaching job (in an at-will employment state) at the beginning of the summer when I was getting absolutely zero responses from other job applications. Recently, I was contacted with a better offer (remote, better pay, etc.) and decided to resign a few weeks before the school year started.

After researching the school a bit more (it's a charter school, not private), I realized that they have some serious issues that clash with my values—they are homophobic, transphobic, and don't allow students or teachers to have piercings, dyed hair, facial hair, etc. As soon as I found another opportunity, I quit.

Now, they are trying to make me pay a $3,500 fee. The contract seems to contradict itself: on one page, it says that we are in an at-will agreement and that employment can be ended at any time without penalty, but later it states that if the employee quits before the school year is finished, they must pay $3,500.

I'm attaching pictures of the contract below. I need advice on whether this contract is enforceable or not because I panicked and asked for my job back, which they agreed to, but I really don't want to take it, especially with a better offer on the table and I know now that they can potentially fire me at any time but I can't quit.

Thanks in advance for any help or guidance you can provide!

Ever since the company hired my new supervisor, they have been expecting me to be in the office 5 days a week taking on additional tasks that are outside of my scope. On top of that, I am still expected to meet my monthly metrics. I notice I have been expected to complete tasks that usually the supervisor is expected to do. I also notice they want me to be in the building every day because I do the grunt work for everyone and manage daily operations when I am there. 

The last two months, my supervisor hired a friend of theirs to take on a large position in the company which has important/huge responsibilities that require them to be in the building 5 days a week full-time. Instead of this employee taking on their responsibility, they decide to work from 5 days a week down to 0-1 day a week. Guess who ended up finishing all of their unfinished business? Me. 

On top of my own work, I worked long hours to catch up on other work left behind.. and instead of receiving a thank you for my hard work and going above and beyond - I was criticized for not attending a 30 minute morning huddle meeting with the other managers for 1 week (because I was out on the field trying to finish this other persons task on top of my own). When I asked if I could join the huddle remotely so I can multi-task and stay efficient/productive - I was told ""no"" and that it was mandatory I attend in person. Side note - these morning huddles are not at all productive and is spent mostly with managers joking around, making inappropriate jokes, and gossiping.

Lastly, we recently promoted an employee to fill a role I was also doing for the past 7 months so that I could focus on the position I was hired for. There was no training plan for the promoted person, since I am the only person that knows how to do the job. I asked my supervisor via email last Thursday if I could temporarily work 1 weekend day, and take 1 weekday off for 2 weeks so that I could come in and train this person for their new position. I received an email this afternoon from my supervisor, denying my request that she needs me to work weekdays only.. with no solution as to who can train this person. 

I am extremely frustrated because I don't understand why my supervisor is making things difficult without offering support or a solution. At this point, I am strongly considering calling off work every day this week and job hunt elsewhere.

I started this job at the beginning of June. from the beginning it was bad. this was a family owned company. The son in law was the only outside sales member, until he hired me. I assumed he'd take me under his wing and teach me and all of that. I was hired as the very first outside sales rep under this man. 

  
It has been a shit show from the start. this man spent no more than 30 minutes actually training or teaching me. He didn't explain anything to me, he didn't lay out any sort of training schedule for me, he quite literally acted as if I wasn't there. He'd go on sales appointments, wouldn't bring me, wouldn't tell me about them, like I had to double check that my job was in fact outside sales. 

  
so today I got fired. they told me It just wasn't working out and they just couldn't figure out why I wasn't asking to join in on these sales appointments. I didn't realize that it was up to me to forge my own path and demand my boss takes me on his sales appointments, that feels like overstepping. he was flying to California, but yeah, take me on your sales appointments and buy me a flight, hotel, and food. Am I ridiculous for not doing that? I kept waiting and waiting for this man to give me an ounce of attention. I kept waiting for him to ask me if I wanna join in on sales calls. I kept waiting to be given the clearance to leave the office and find my own customers.

Yes I've been making phone calls, but I do not know what probing questions to ask. my boss said to me 3 weeks ago ""next week we will make some calls together does that sound good?"" well, wouldn't you know it, those calls never materialized. so perhaps my confidence would've been higher if I had my manager coaching me and working with me and helping me. instead it was pretty much you're on your own. 

  
the entire time I worked there this man did not breathe a single word to me about going out there and visiting my own customers. im not lying, not one word, not after my interview. So finally I got so angry and frustrated that I looked for businesses in the area we could maybe work with. I didn't know how to qualify a lead. I didn't know how to look at a website and decide if it'd be viable. he said he'd show me but he never did so I got frustrated and figured it out myself. when I showed him my list, again, he never said to me ""go find some business"" he said ""ok great now call them"" he didn't say SHIT about what is I say on these phone calls?! he even promised to do some with me but he failed to. 

  
I'm so fucking upset man. I asked this guy for more training material, he sent me to the YouTube page where I watched a WORDLESS COMMERCIAL. how the fuck is that gonna help me learn the product?! its not. I asked him for more worksheets to recognize part numbers, he said yes and never brought them to. but this meeting was very much them cleaning their hands of any culpability and blaming me. 

  
I think these people were out of their depth hiring someone as they had non idea how to manage or train. When, being fired, I asked for severance, they had absolutely no idea what severance was. none at all. they planned to give me $0. I got them to give me a week of pay. now as for the 15 days of PTO that I had, I have no idea what happens to those. I'd like it to be paid out to me but im unsure that'll happen. they also told me that they heard me yawning once which means that im apparently bored and incapable of having enthusiasm. im sorry...?! He also told me in my first week that I was yawning which gave him a bad vibe. so since then I stifled my yawns and only indulged in those on my lunch breaks or in private in the bathroom. so I know she did not hear me yawn. but even so, I don't see how a yawn makes me unfitting for a job. 

  
tired of feeling like garbage. im tired of people not giving a single fuck about me. im tired of feeling disposable. im especially irate that I was fired and blamed for it because my manager took such an idle stance. im half tempted to schedule a phone call with him and let him have a piece of my mind. I defended myself as best as I could but it was still hard. I maintained confidence and was able to get myself a week of severance pay somehow but still I wanted to say more. he was so idle that it blew me away. he leaves the office for 2 weeks at a time and doesn't check in with me. 

  
the cherry on top, this man did not come into the office until 4:30 today. they fired me at 4:45. you couldn't give me a half day when you knew I was being fired?! I just stood around working all day like an asshole even when you knew you were going to fire me?!

  
I feel  like I was really unfairly treated and I was not made a priority and then they fired me and said it was my fault. im mad now. fuck these people. "

I could not access via my phone, which is my back up plan.  I had to clear my cache and update my drivers, which was going very slowly.  

I had missed the first 20 minutes of a 1 hour call.  As soon as I was up and running, I immediately communicated separately to the colleague in question as well as the customer and colleague collectively.  

I apologized, explained what happened, and I got everyone’s availability and rescheduled. We had some banter back and forth, good nature and a joke from the customer.  I had done some Extra work efforts for which I delivered to them first thing this morning, hours before our scheduled call.  I believe that I have a good relationship with the customer and that they appreciate what I do for them as they expressed so on a collective call last week.

Once all was said and done, rescheduled, etc, my colleague responded to everyone(customer and me, and my Boss), expressing how pissed off he was and that it was unacceptable and then indicated that he had contacted my boss.

I am pissed, this was uncalled for, unnecessary and unprofessional.  I want to say something, but not sure if I just let it go, talk to him or talk to my boss.

I started this job at the beginning of June. from the beginning it was bad. this was a family owned company. The son in law was the only outside sales member, until he hired me. I assumed he'd take me under his wing and teach me and all of that. I was hired as the very first outside sales rep under this man.

It has been a shit show from the start. this man spent no more than 30 minutes actually training or teaching me. He didn't explain anything to me, he didn't lay out any sort of training schedule for me, he quite literally acted as if I wasn't there. He'd go on sales appointments, wouldn't bring me, wouldn't tell me about them, like I had to double check that my job was in fact outside sales.

so today I got fired. they told me It just wasn't working out and they just couldn't figure out why I wasn't asking to join in on these sales appointments. I didn't realize that it was up to me to forge my own path and demand my boss takes me on his sales appointments, that feels like overstepping. he was flying to California, but yeah, take me on your sales appointments and buy me a flight, hotel, and food. Am I ridiculous for not doing that? I kept waiting and waiting for this man to give me an ounce of attention. I kept waiting for him to ask me if I wanna join in on sales calls. I kept waiting to be given the clearance to leave the office and find my own customers.

My previous barista jobs had training periods, but none required me to take four tests over a month. It feels excessive for a minimum wage job with bad tips. The work environment is very hostile, and I don’t feel liked there. I usually keep to myself and don't take things personally, but I would rather work somewhere where I am respected. 

Since I am still technically in the training period, I decided it’s best to quit now (I have work tomorrow morning, but I am dreading it). I don’t know if I should text my manager now or before my shift tomorrow and I don’t really know what to say without coming off as rude.

**Little context, im a grunt in a warehouse, i worked first where they expected of me and gave me the responsibility of running a failed department. I stupidly took it on after promises of a promotio, after a year of proving myself i asked for my raise in which i was told i was threatening because i didn't sit down. I aksed to move to secound and got jerked around for 3 months before me and my direct boss got into an argument in which i demanded to be moved to second.**
 
So today i asked my supervisor and manager to no longer include me in group text for work anymore. I made sure my request was very professional to not seem rude.
 
I was ambushed near the end of work about this by the Big boss (my bosses boss) who came up to me and stared me down for a minute before asking why i had an attitude and no longer wanted to be included in group text. When i responded with apologizing that it sounded rude and that wasn't my intention he cut me off to continue to tell me i had an attitude. I asked if i wasn't allowed to ask to no longer be texted and he just said ""you have your opinion i have mine"". 

When asked how he can get a hold of me i told him that we do have 2 shared work emails i have full access to in which he can reach me. Mind you this request isnt just for me and my lead also received the text. He responded by saying he doesn't have email on his phone. 
Well i was stupid and told him "" I'm not trying to be rude or a smart ass, but you could download email on your phone, or wait till you're home to send one."" Im which he responded by throwing his hands up, claiming he just cant deal with my attitude, and walking away. The whole interaction took less than 5 min. 

Now I guess my questions are how do i approach this if they turn it into an issue? I know im not required to use my phone for work, but can they write me up or punish me for not doing so? Should i go to HR befor this gets worse? What can i do if i get punished for this? Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

Just last week I was scolded by my supervisor in front of all my coworkers for being 10 minutes late to work. I apologized and told my PM this would not happen again. However, after I went home for the day it really didn't sit right with me that he yelled at me in front of everyone. I fully understand that being late is unacceptable and there's no excuses for this, but I thought that was really unprofessional of him. He even did me the favor of letting me know that if he could he would've fired me, but he doesn't have the power to. My work starts at 8am everyone sits in the break room chatting/gossiping until 8:40am ish before starting the day. I'm working the last 2 weeks of my 2-week notice, and I will admit I haven't always been the best at being on time, normally 5\~10 minutes late.

2,2024-07-23,My colleague Karen’s unhappiness is contagious,u/original_don_dada,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ea1a93/my_colleague_karens_unhappiness_is_contagious/,antiwork,"My [35F] colleague’s [30F] unhappiness is having a toll on my mental health.

Background

She (let’s call her Karen) started a working at this company a month after me and it’s been 5 years. We lived through the pandemic over zoom calls and it was fine, like us versus the world. And then I got my first promotion which was proposed by my super boss and not the current manager then and this turned everything sour for us.

We are both married but she treats her marriage as the worse thing ever and discusses all her quarrels with me and I know the problem is her because she is always bickering about everything. Less pay, more work, “useless managers”…everything! And believe me, it is not at all that bad…work is pretty chill but she has to complain.

Work:

Karen is not very good technically but she covers it with hard work, and I have to give credit where it’s due. But I have pushed her to learn basics that willl help her excel at her work, essentially to help her work smart and not hard. But there’s a huge push back. She says she is “too dumb to learn anything new”, yet she is expecting a pay raise everywhere which does get but “it’s not enough for the amount of work I put in.”

She says she doesn’t like her SO, so she wants to spend more and more time here in the office. She has this habit of staying back until the boss has left and ensure that she has a bit of small talk daily “for visibility sake”, not quite sure what it means. But I know the real reason to stay back (in her own words many times) is to have the free food (dinner so she doesn’t have to cook at home) at work (that’s how good the company is). Everyone else in our team leaves at 5 but this hard worker.

Gossiping:

The moment she steps in, she start bad mouthing everyone but very carefully - she knows who to talk about in front of whom and that she has mastered. But you know who bullshits abt someone to you is bound to bullshit abt you to others.

At times over the past 5 years she has rubbed off a few others wrongly and I was warned abt it by them, who asked me to “be vary of her”.

Relationship with managers:

She constantly complains to them about various work related issues and I feel they understand why and are generally not too supportive of our solutions for problems she brings to them. She wants them “to fight for her” but what she is talking about is always non issues or things that can be sorted by her with just a little patience or dialog with the other party, whoever they may be.

Our manager and his manager are both from the same towns, we work in the city. She always talks to them gently reminding them of this fact and how we (the rest of the team) are foreign to them, we are all from different towns.

Current situation:

Most of the colleagues she used to gossip with are leaving the company for reasons not related to her, and she is constantly asking them to refer her in a position at their company but no one has contacted her once they left which says a lot.

I believe I’m lined up for a promotion in the current appraisal cycle and I am already scared that she will become even more aggressive towards me and this will further strain my mental health.

I told her that if she is this unhappy with everything, the she should find a different job, but 1. She can’t find another job, 2. She thinks I am “getting rid of her competition”…sheesh!

About me:

I’m pretty good at what I do. I have done work that impacts the team positively and everyone else says the same. I am getting more responsibilities than my actual work which I feel is a good sign. I am able to get my work done prioritising everything and involve her in some of my work but she is taking credit for the whole project I feel.

I must have gotten pulled into her web of gossips and might’ve agreed to what she said some times which makes me a partner in her crimes? I’m not sure. If I tell her to stop she is unhappy and will not talk to me. Karen also feels that since she has joined just a month before me, she is just as good as me and this I have heard from other where she was trying to tell them that she deserves the promotion just as much because we have exactly the same amount of experience at this job.

Question:

How do I deal with this and save my mental health?"

The top 1% of thr economy pays for their laws to get passed, while everyone else gets fucked.  No more! 

I am absolutely 100% serious about using their own tactics against them.  There's way more of us than there is them.  Let's use our numbers to create the largest lobbist firm in the nation.  

If lobbying and paying politicians for new laws is the only way to make a change, then why not play the game too?  

I will be actively working on starting a lobbist firm called The99.  We are the 99%, and we are absolutely tired of the bullshit.  I just don't know where to start.  According to the internet, the firm must be incorporated and be a licensed business in the state it was founded.  If you are a lawyer, and you know how to get this started, and you're ready to step up and make a real change, message me.  

The top 1% in the USA is 3 million people.
The 99% is 330 million people.  
330 million people can make a difference.  

If you're tired of working 50+ hours a week, busy still wonder where your next meal is going to come from

If you lie awake at night stressing over your bills being able to get paid

If you are ready for a society that doesn't require 2 full time incomes per household just to survive, much less thrive

If you're ready to spend more than 2 hours a night with your kids every night 

If you're ready to be able to afford 1 reasonable vacation a year

If you're ready for your voice to be heard and to make a difference

If you're tired of absolutely 0 workers rights 

If you're tired of legal discrimination 

Then join me, and everyone else who is absolutely fed up in the founding of The99! 

This lobbyist firm will back no official political party.  This firm is what the government no longer is.  For the people, by the people.  

If our elected representation only vote for the highest bidder, it's time we all band together and become the highest bidder.  

We can absolutely do this.

As I’d been on the team the longest, I was volunteered to be the spokesman. 

Our basic salary was shite. About £14k p/a but boosted by bonuses, which were set to just above attainable. 

Between us, around ten people, we were bringing in over £1.5m every year to the company coffers. This was early 2000’s. 

At least two of the team would have been better off financially by claiming benefits and not working. That’s how bad it was. 

Meeting was held between myself, my direct boss, and a director. 

I laid out what myself and the team had been discussing. They tried to go down the route of “you should not be discussing salaries amongst each other”. 

That was swiftly shut down by pointing out that legally we can talk about them. Especially when some are on more money for doing the same job. 

Got to the nitty gritty and explained that we are looking for a £2000 rise across the team, which would just keep us afloat. This is a multi billion pound turnover company, with multi million pound profits, so that amount would not have even dented anything. 

There was a very emphatic no. This wasn’t going to happen. 

Fair enough. 

I told them that I’d be immediately looking for a better paid job. 

The meeting ended with handshakes all around. 

I eventually got another job which paid twice my salary, no need for bonuses, and half the hours I was currently doing. 

I accepted that job immediately and arranged another meeting with my direct boss, and took my newly signed contract with me. 

He looked stunned and told me that that was more than he was making, and he was doing at least 100 hours a week. (Married, at the time, guy with a family). 

I took up my new employment and I enjoyed it. Eventually earning around £60k a year for a 35 hour week. 

As a result I was able to retire a good few years earlier than expected. (AVC’s and a very good company pension fund). 

Within the first six months of my new job I was phoned three times asking me to go back. They could not get anyone in my location at the salary they paid me and my colleagues. 

The answer, when they called, was always the same. “Are you kidding?” And “how much is the salary now?” They increased the salary but not high enough that they were getting serious applications. 

The rest of the team all left within 18 months to far better paying jobs, including three who went self employed taking a huge chunk of the business with them. 

Those three now have teams working for them, and pay them liveable salaries. 

The worst thing was, if they’d have given us the £2000 pay rise, we would have stayed. It was an enjoyable job but the wages were awful. 

The moral of the story is look after your staff and they will look after you. "

I loved this small group since the 3 of us all pulled our weight with minimal middle management and even then it was coming from #1 who was a doer and made it palatable. Fast forward to today, new company, same people and talents. #1 is inhaling the CEO / Founder vapors which is to be expected but #2 who used to be a workhouse is fully ascended into middle management BS. Always trying out some new time tracking software, creating tasks for me within minutes of getting feedback (that I've already begun and discussed with our client) just so she can feel involved. 

What was once a flat team of doers is now 2 people watching the spreadsheet. Which doesn't help me hit deadlines at all and just adds a huge layer of unnecessary annoyance just so someone else can call themselves a ""manager"". I genuinely hate the direction the new company is going and want to bail but I really need to beef out a year for my resume. "

2.  You have to manage productivity, supervise, train, and discipline employees.  And you also have to unload trucks, sort product, and build pallets.  Because this is, as described in the job position, is a ""working"" supervisor position.  As if running the entire shift isn't enough.

3.  This position pays a whopping $65 - $72,800k a year.  I am a retired logistics manager.  I recently found a paystub from 2002 when I was making $57k a year only 4 years out of college.  Things have gotten a little pricier since then.

I work at a café and all the staff is pretty close. Before I left, I made a load of meringue cookies because I had a bunch of eggs that would rot in the fridge if I left them. After giving tons away, I still had a bunch left and thought I'd do something nice for my coworkers and drop off a bunch in the breakroom. There was a note on top that said they were from me and to be eaten by the employees.
I come back from vacation and ask one of my coworkers if anyone liked the meringues and she was like ""the ones in the display?"" I went to the front of the store, looked at the display cabinet and saw (with few left) the basket of my cookies with a price tag sticker of $2 for 3 (probably stale as hell by now)

Apparently my boss found them in the morning, and decided to sell my gift to my coworkers for a profit. Not to mention that it's totally against food safety regulations to sell them. I told him that I was hurt by this and that the revenue from the sales should go towards our tips, and that I didn't want him to sell them. He comes heavy on the defense saying how ""they were a gift so it shouldn't matter"". 
I did stand up for myself and let him know that that was a very rude and shitty thing to do to someone regardless of if I'm his employee or not. 
I just feel soooo frustrated. Worked here for two years, never called in or been late. This might be the final straw for me though.

So essentially, you no longer have a store manager, a couple managers, a few key holders, and a couple shift leads. Now, for our store (and most stores), you have one store manager, one assistant manager, two key holders, and one shift leader. The responsibilities are a lot and no one above the store manager seems to understand that it’s difficult to accomplish every expectation when you’re just trying to get by.

For instance, the district manager doesn’t understand that the store setup isn’t like how it was when she was a store manager. She was used to being surrounded by a team of experienced managers. That’s no longer the case. They took away those manager spots, so all of these so called objectives are nearly impossible to reach. Replacing an experienced assistant manager with an associate is a huge difference maker.

An even funnier thing. The pool of applicants for the latest assistant manager position was intense. Almost everyone had a bachelor’s degree and at the very least held a minor management role at another place. All of that just so they can get paid $17.50 with immense expectations to carry the store when the store manager isn’t there. And there is usually a ton of customer traffic. That’s not that much more than minimum wage."

Of 315 applications, nearly 75% of my applications were ghosted - meaning companies never respond back to me after I apply. Then, about 25% of roles that I was referred to or applied for are instant rejections, even after tens of resumes where I changed my work experience. I only had two roles that called me for interviews - both Data Analyst roles at Princeton University. One I was the backup candidate after flying out and interviewing and the other I was ghosted after the second round of interviews.

From what I read on Forbes, Business Insider, and a few other sources:

- Companies post fake roles to give the impression to shareholders that they are growing. (This should be illegal.)

- Companies are reducing job openings for one to do the work of multiple roles. For example, at a company called CDW, I applied for three separate roles and was referred to one through WorkDay. The next day, CDW changed two openings into one role and eliminated the third. Why do companies do this? Shareholders can save more money by cutting jobs.

- Companies do not know what they want and end up changing the position or eliminating the role entirely.

- Companies want to give a false impression, to teams that ask for another member to aid in their work, that they are hiring but do not act on it.

I could go on, and as someone who has been unemployed for seven months, tested and passed a certification, changed his resume due to name discrimination and elaborating on work experience, and is networking and trying to attend data events, it is excruciatingly exhausting to find a job. I do not know if lowering federal interest rates will slowly change companies hiring process. I am very much antiwork, but also need income. The whole experience has made me lose hope for especially younger generations. This is going to fuel into an ""antiwork"" regime for many college grads which is not bad, but I feel sad for many new graduates or job-seekers who will be dependent on others and feel hopeless about starting or pivoting their career."

Unfortunately, I've been informed that my funding will end on August 30th. I have a family, which includes my wife and three kids, and we’re not currently on any medical insurance plan. They didn’t qualify for Medicaid because my salary was just above the threshold. I didn’t add them during the last enrollment period due to various reasons—it’s a long story.



Right now, I have the opportunity to add them to my current insurance plan since the new enrollment period started on July 15th and runs until July 30th. However, this insurance wouldn’t take effect until September, and I’ll be leaving my current job at the end of August. I plan to take some time off to find a good job, which means I’ll be unemployed for few months.



Given this situation, I’m considering applying for Medicaid for my family and me once I’m unemployed.



I’m seeking advice on the best course of action here. Should I go ahead and add them to the insurance plan even though it will only be effective starting September? Or would it be more practical to wait and apply for Medicaid once my employment ends? Any guidance or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

So…you grow the business with the same amount of employees while you still stay home? Fine. Don’t you dare expect me to change my pace.

We complain about caring about shareholders over employees a lot here. They care about extracting as much wealth from labor as possible to enrich themselves and other capitalists (shareholders). It's rational self-interest.

**Here's the thing: working-class people should also practice rational self-interest.**

The product you sell is your labor, and just like a capitalist **your goal should be to extract the highest amount of money possible for the smallest amount of your product possible.** Whatever the market will allow that's what you should charge.

* If you can get away with doing less at your job and get paid the same you should do it.
* If you can produce lower-quality work and get paid the same or more for it (perhaps because a boss or client values speed over quality) you should do it.
* If you can find loopholes to get paid for doing nothing you should utilize them to the fullest extent.

The goal of any socialist project is to get the working class what they are due, which is the full value of their labor. That's why we and capitalists are ""contending classes"" and we are in ""class conflict."" We both want the same thing - money and power. We just so happen to be on the right side of history because it is us who provide the actually valuable product.

Make them pay through the nose for it."

And I was wondering, does anyone even enjoy these? Do managers enjoy them? Single people? Parents because the get a break?

Or are we all reluctantly dragging ourselves out to picnics, bowling, paint nights, cocktail networking parties, golfing and sporting events just because we all think someone, somewhere enjoys them?

I can't remember one work event held after hours that I genuinely looked forward to and enjoyed. Sure, the few things we have during work hours that get us out of the office are great, mostly because it's better than working, but never has anything after work been so great I've been excited for it.

Feeling sad and need to vent ",u/EllieKong,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eall2x/husband_got_fired_again_feeling_sad_and_need_to/,antiwork,"My husband is an incredible worker, no matter what he’s doing, he tries his hardest and surpasses every expectation possible with flying colours. He’s super personable, no drama, knowledgeable beyond any job description (AuDHD). Every employer he’s had has LOVED him. 

My husband worked at a bar for about 3 years and started 3 weeks after the bar opened, he alone helped build their clientele for 2 years. The owners didn’t give a shit about the bar and we’re super hands off, my husband loved that because it made his job so much easier. Fast forward to his last year of work, the owners started getting way more involved and shitty. My husband noticed that tips were missing and when he’d bring it up, they’d tell him not to worry about it and they’d take care of it. But it kept happening and more was being taken. My husband brought it up on two more separate occasions where their responses starting getting a bit more hostile. My husband caught on and started documenting everything immediately. Literally the entire staff’s pay, hours, how many tips he counted at the end of the night and how that compared to the final tip pool number. In the span of 4 months, he documented over $5k of tips stolen. The staff had a big meeting, my husband brought up his pay cheque not matching the tip pool for one night (that night alone they took about $900), they immediately shut him down and told them all that it was the final time they were talking about tips and they weren’t allowed to ask again. My husband never told them about the document he created as he was waiting for everyone’s information, so he could calculate it properly. Being the strong worker he is, he worked through all over thanksgiving, Christmas, news years, Chinese new years and balance time day seasons. Many night he worked until 4am, was working by himself or close to it. February 15th 2023 he got a call from his employer, who ended up firing him. My husband asked why, they said they wouldn’t tell him, but he demanding to know why. After asking many questions and them beating around the bush, his employer cut him off mid sentence and yelled “you’re fired, it doesn’t matter, weren’t not having you come back”, to which my beautiful person responded “oh I would never dream of coming back after you doing this to me, but I have a right to know why”. This utterly shocked the employer, it was very clear that’s not the response he was expecting and he started to hesitate and panic a bit. My husband saw his opportunity and started hounding questions again and when the responses weren’t good enough, he refuted with logic. The pressure piled on and his employer let slip that they were clearing house. My husband gave the dude an ear full, said he would be contacting his lawyer and then hung up on him. 

They wanted my husband gone before Christmas (they changed a lot after they knew he was keeping an eye on tips), but clearly kept him for the busy season and fired him AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Literally the day after busy season finished. As a side note, my husband contacted his coworkers and told them about the call, two weeks later on the busiest trivia night of the week, the staff waited for trivia folks to start lining up and then they walked out leaving the company employee-less lol. A week after this, a new employee got bitten by a customers dog right beside the owner. The owner didn’t even acknowledge it until someone pointed it out, asked if the employee was okay and then left… after the employee said no. They were taken to the hospital by another random customer and had to get stitches. The employers refused to pay the medical bills. Hopes this paints a picture of how truly scummy these guys are. They have since rebranded 😂

My husband has been looking for a job ever since, we live in a HCOL area and I work in healthcare making a measly $20/hour part time, (I asked for numerous large raises hoping to negotiate and got much better raises, but still shit - 75 more cents - even though “they couldn’t run the office without me”) as I’m also a med student. We had to go down to 1 meal a day because we couldn’t afford more and the food bank was rotting produce. The doctors at my practice found out when I started puking one day and after questioning me to figure out what was wrong, I told them we weren’t getting enough. Since then, they (and two others) brought my husband and I meals every single week. Every damn week. 

After 1.5 years and many really shitty interviews or ones that didn’t go anywhere, my husband FINALLY got a job, still working with alcohol, he waited 3 weeks and did 2 interviews, he LOVED him. We’re literally glowing. During the offer phone call my husband let them know that his best friend was getting married this past weekend in Seattle and was in the wedding party, he requested 3 days off for that and for half a year have been planning a 3 week trip to Canada to visit my family whom we’ve not seen in 5 years.  We had to bring our dogs, so we had to road trip. We recognized that it was a big ask and poor timing and we privately discussed pushing our trip back in case there was an issue because the employee meant was more important. The lady owner said that should be fine and wanted to double check with her husband (male owner) first and she’d call us back. She called back and said there was no issue, we were ecstatic and really hopeful about this job and employer. Because of their generosity, he made sure to work extra hard at his one shift last week before going on his trip. He tried to get to know everyone, did more than was required and was teaching them about a lot of stuff too, including technology (like not being able to fix their payment systems.. how do you run a business and not know how to do this? They were just going to close…). They said they were SO excited to have him and were giving him raving reviews, just glowing. He was so happy. 

So yesterday morning we were flying in from Seattle and at 630, he sent the owners a text saying he was so sorry, but his flight was delayed and he’d get into work an hour late, to which they quickly responded that it wasn’t a problem at all as they would just be packing some small boxes. He gets into work before he even told them he’d be there and 4 hours later, a manager my husband hadn’t met yet walked in and within 15 minutes asked to speak to my husband. They pulled him into the office and said “this isnt going to work out”. Shocked, my husband said “oh okay, did I do something wrong?” “No.” “Okay…. Do you have any constructive feedback?” “No you’ve done nothing wrong” “okay.. so why am I being fired?” “I’m not discussing this further, we’re done here”, then proceeded to ignore every question my husband tried asking after that before he knew it was a lost cause and he wasn’t getting info. As he was walking home, he texted the lady owner and said he was not happy with what happened, that it wasn’t okay for them to do what they did and they could have sent you that text earlier knowing we were on a plane, rather than having him come in and work. He also let them know that our flight was overbooked and we lost out on $3k flight credit to delay our flight by a day, just so he could be at work. We were going to push our trip to Canada back a few months to accommodate for another day gone and because they had been so accommodating, so he was really pissed off that they mistreated him without reason and he missed out on SO much (that amount of flight credit would have literally been life changing for us). We have absolutely no idea why he was fired and can only make assumptions, one being the time off (they never mentioned it might be an issue after they approved it) and the other that they may have looked my husband up online and saw that he has a tech portfolio. He’s had a big gap in tech and after being fired last year, he got insanely motivated to get back into tech, which hasn’t happened yet (again such shitty timing with all the lay offs lol) and maybe thought he would jump ship. Which he would have. Again these are not assumptions, we have no idea other than these two guesses. 

Today is my husbands birthday. I’m trying to celebrate him, but growing up only being praised if he accomplished something, it’s hard to do since he’s taken such a hit to his mental health and self worth. This experience has made him realize he’s done with the liquor industry and is diving in head first for tech. We know we’ll be okay, but it’s hard to be okay now, especially when rents due next week and we only have $62 in our account. We try doing Uber, but everyone else is also broke that we rarely get orders, we went out twice a day everyday. 

My husband is looking into unemployment to see if he qualifies again and is in the middle of hearing back about a second hearing with the first company (labour board said they theoretically should be owing us $8-10k, but the employers keep delaying it) to get what he’s owed. We’re so sick of LITERALLY starving ourselves to deal with employers like this. Not sure what I’m asking, but just feel like I need to vent. 

TDLR: my husband got fired from two different jobs 1.5 years apart with no reason given. Employers are super shit, we’re super broke and pissed about being alive right now 😂"

That being said my boss has continually promised me job promotion (and raises) over the last two years but instead has given me more work under the guise of “training” to the point that I’m doing the work of at least two people. Most recently I was promised that my job and another coworker’s (who just left the company and I absorbed their duties) would be redistributed so I’d get all of the stuff I like and the new hire would get the boring stuff. Today I was told that’s not happening anymore and I’d essentially keep doing all of the original extra work (not the new extra work) but now with no hope of promotion. 

Should I stay and see how things pan out? Should I try and talk to HR about how I’m doing a ton of extra work outside of my job description? 
Should I just start looking for something else and risk losing the security?

She's overwhelmed and fed up with how her main supervisor has been treating her about needing to take time off. 

She works part time for a company that produces food packaging products. Her schedule is pretty flexible in that she can go into their computer system at the beginning of each week and put in for what days and times she's available for the next week and they will schedule her accordingly. But there doesn't seem to be much flexibility as far as last minute things are concerned. She has an autoimmune disease and struggles with chronic illnesses a lot. They get some sick time and personal days, but as a part timer, it isn't a lot. She started in 2021 and they used to be a little more lenient with illnesses, but started cracking down within the last year. 

Back around January or February she had to be out for a couple of weeks due to a combination of covid and a flareup of her autoimmune issues. Her department supervisor (or her supervisor's supervisor) had kind of a talk with her and told her she really needed to watch her attendance because she had gone beyond allotted sick days and they'd only let her return with a doctors excuse, and so on. 

She decided to get more proactive with her health stuff. Tried some new medications, started researching about dietary changes she could make to limit flareups, and so on. And she had been doing really good. Feeling better overall, and not missing any work. 

Last week her sister in law passed away. Her brother is currently incarcerated, and the brother and sister in law have 2 kids. She called work to let them know and they said they needed some kind of documentation. I think that's scummy, but fair enough. I understand some places have those policies. So she goes, helps with arrangements, and now she needs to figure out what to do with the kids. Her SIL's family aren't in the best circumstances themselves. Her own family isn't really equipped, so she's taking them for now I guess. She called her department supervisor today to discuss this to see if she could take some unpaid time off to arrange to take on 2 kids for who knows how long. 

She called this woman directly because she knew that her own supervisor would have to run everything by her anyways. She explained the situation, and instead of responding with any kind of sympathy or understanding, this lady immediately cuts her off and starts asking her about documentation. She asked for the SILS name. She tries an online search for the name but couldn't find anything. My friend said she had a little pamphlet from the celebration of life they had, so the lady asks her to email her a picture of it within 10 minutes. 

So my friend sends it to her. And the lady emails her back saying she needs to see the whole pamphlet because ""there's not much information there"" But I guess it was just a one page card type thing with the name, relevant dates, and time/address of the celebration of life. So my friend tells her that, even offers to show her the death certificate once it comes. My friend hears nothing back for a good, long while. 

This would be a good time to add that her SIL died young, unexpectedly, and without life insurance. She also came from a pretty poor and disconnected family. So there was no fancy funeral home wake with a church service, flowers, catered lunch, graveside service, and all of that. It was basically just family scraping together what they could to have her cremated and have a little get together in a park. They probably couldn't even afford that. 

Finally my friend gets an email back that says something like ""Thank you for sending what you have. We will take you off the schedule for now. Please let us know when you are able to return."" Like it was sent by a totally different person or something, because the tone change is just...

I'm guessing that the lady (department supervisor) had to run it by HR and they told her she was being unreasonable. Because I don't think this lady has the final say, though it sure sounds like she wishes she did. It's like she was on a freaking power trip. And all of this time off would be unpaid, so it's not like my friend was trying to take advantage of the company and get something she hadn't earned. And it's not like this place is a hospital or store or something where if someone doesn't come in everyone is forced to pick up the slack. It's a production facility where they've been overstaffed and ahead of schedule to the point of having to cancel or cut some shifts. 

I think my friend had a grandparent die last fall that she might have needed to take off for. But other than that it's not one of those situations where someone has had 6 grandparents die just within the last year or whatever. 

I'm telling her she should look for another job, and she has been. But there's not a lot of opportunities where we live. But other than that I don't know what to tell her. She's really upset and feels disrespected. She said she's been working so hard to stay healthy and to not be so much as a minute late, and has been successful since winter. But now something major comes up and all this bitch cares about is ""proof"". For unpaid time off! What a cow. I hope she did run it by HR and they told her to quit being such a bitch. "

The day is already over and I have no time left. I have no time for relationships or friends or anything. I feel like I don't even have time to just sit and think to myself. By the time I finally start to unwind, I have to cut my day off and go to bed early so I'm not dead the next day. And then I have a hard time sleeping anyway thinking about how I have to repeat the same BS all over again in a few hours. And then this is just going to be the rest of my life. 

I don't understand people who are so enthusiastic to go to work. I hear people talking about how it gives them purpose and identity and gives them ""something to do"". I'd rather be sitting on my ass and staring at the wall than spend my entire days caged up under florescent lights being told what to do. "

He was constantly going on about how excited he was to retire, and when he finally did he realized that what he was getting back wasn't enough to sustain himself, so he went back to work, and hearing about this is just heartbreaking and infuriating. 

Even worse, recently he got fed up with the way he was being treated by another employee, and asked to be transferred to another department to avoid said person, only to be punished with a night time shift which his body isn't accustomed to, so he quit. 30 years of company loyalty meant nothing. 

Now he doesn't know what to do, he retired, came back, quit due to mistreatment, and now he doesn't know what to do anymore. It's going to be difficult for a company to hire him due to his age, but even worse, he shouldn't even have to be looking for work at his age! His body is old and tired, he deserves to rest, but unfortunately the sky high cost of living won't allow for that. We literally have to work until we literally just drop dead, retirement doesn't account for inflation at all and it's horrible. "

1,2024-07-24,Dubai Based Fintech Startup Not Paying Employees,u/Xochi89,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eatvtu/dubai_based_fintech_startup_not_paying_employees/,antiwork,"I'm a software engineer with 13+ experience. And back in late 2023 I had a stable job in my country of residence. Although I wan't actively looking, an opportunity presented itself that offered a much better package (I was just making ends meet at the time - having a wife and two small children). 

It's a startup and so as every software person knows by now - you do your due research before joining a startup. I found they we're Dubai based and their biggest investor and backer is Mashreq Bank. I believe at a later stage they also bought on Magnati bank.

Needless to say - the startup is in the Fintech space - a payment service provider much like Stripe. So after doing my research I felt at least relatively assured that they have all their things in order, and the ""startup madness"" might be kept to a minimum. The team I would be working with is also 100% remote and global. The startup doesn't have a physical office space

The first few months were interesting - and it just got more bizarre and dodgy as time went on. (Which we'll get to). For the sake of being succinct I'll just show a timestamped bullet point list of the events that took place:

**The initial few months**

* **November 2023**: Joined, along with roughly 15 other contractors The team was growing rapidly and work was going fine 
* **February 2024**: Get a surprise Slack message requesting I fly to Doha, and stay in the Ritz for a few days (fully company paid of course). 
* Meet in Doha, find out the the CTO along with another principle level engineer is getting fired because ""the investors and CEO didn't feel they we're delivering"". At the same time, I met roughly 10 other employees / engineers (my colleagues it turns out that I've never met or spoken to in my life). 
* Turns out they were the ""take over team"", and I was told a lot is going to change - there's going to be a lot of restructuring. 
* The next 3 days: Brainstorming on how we're going to build this new platform from scratch (all other code for the platform that was written up till then was trashed). And mingling with my - I guess - new colleagues. 
* Land back in my home country and development is now at a steady pace and things are looking good,. No unreasonable expectations

  
**When it started getting dodgy**  
*PS - Our payday was on the 15th/16th of every month, for work done the prior month*

- **May 13th** : Two days before our April salaries were due, we were informed via email that the May payroll cycle would be offset by two weeks. Moving from the 15th/16th to the 30th. (With a promise of a full 45 days worth of pay because of the extra 2 week wait)

- **May 31st**: We receive another email, informing us of yet another 2 week delay due to unforeseen complexities with interbank communication between Dubai and Doha. (Personally - I feel this has nothign to do with the employees, and they should be paid when their contract stipulates when they should get paid. Your irresponsible conduct and lack of foresight and planning shouldn't negatively impact your employees)

- For the next two weeks it was communicated that the project deadline is looming and we need to get it done ASAP. Overtime was worked. Weekends were sacrificed.

- **June 15th**: No communication from the leadership team. Many employees reached out directly to the CEO. but got no responses. 

- **July 4th**: Finally an ""all hands"" meeting is announced and the whole company (42 in total) joins the call. During this call it was announced that all employees would be placed on unpaid leave until further notice, due to the company's financial challenges. (This announcement now came after weeks of working overtime). Right after the meeting, all access was removed from Github, Figma and other work related tools. Interestingly, Slack and Emails we (and are) still up and functional.

- **July 9th**: A Slack message in one of the public channels mentions that no progress has been made, and that daily updates from the management team is not feasible as they can only communicate what is being communicated to them from the banks (**Wio bank** btw). It was said that the removal of access from tools was for ""cost saving purposes"". And they said, and I quote ""We want to assure everyone that there have been no layoffs, nor are there any current restructuring plans"". 

- **Update / Recap**: This is now essentially 3 months without any sort of salary

- **July** **19th (This is where it got really dodgy)**: Some of the Pakistani colleagues were asked to join a call  that (Friday) evening. It was mentioned to them that they (the company) are closing down operations and they will now finally pay their outstanding salaries. We each were handed a laptop when we started there, so an offer was made to either return the laptop, or a deduction of $2000 will be made to what the company owe's them in wages. The next day (Saturday), all colleagues in Karachai who opted to return the laptop got contacted and as some random guy came along and collected the laptops from them - their outstanding salaries were released right then and there. Everyone was requested to download and communicate only over Telegram, and as you can guess - the messages were deleted shortly after the transaction by the CEO.

**An Overview**

So now we have all Karachi-based employees effectively laid off, with no warning and/or severance. The rest of the company is completely unaware of this (as the last comms from management was that no layoffs and/or restructuring is being made.

The only way I (not based in Karachi) and all my other colleagues scattered across the globe (England, Scotland, France, Poland, India, South Africa, Australia, Brazil) know about this, is because we started a WhatsApp group where we're all communicating and keeping in sync (20 of us in total).

The rest of us still haven't received any comms. I was hoping I'd get the ""laptop deal"", take it, and just thank the Gods that I'm done with this horrible person / company.

**My Final Question**

Since I'm not a Dubai citizen - what options do I have? I know the CEO who's responsible for all this is **very** touchy about his image on social media. I'm not obliged to share his info here (I think?) - But if you want any details - email address, phone number, linked in profile etc - just DM me.

Besides all the details around the CEO like contact details, photo etc. I also have the  **DMCC Service License Certificate**, listing the company's License and Account number etc.

Are there officials I can approach? He's a very wealthy individual and I feel going ""legal"" is not going to yield any results. Not that I have any money right now for that anyway. I have to buy groceries and pay my kids school fees off my credit card.

Are there newspapers in the UAE / Dubai that might be interested in a story like this? Just through working with this person - it's his image that he cares about most. He inherited all his money and so any problem in his mind can be solved with enough money. However once word gets out just how unethical he is - that's not something money can make go away.

This man has destroyed lives and caused incomprehensible pain to dozens of families. And I hate to admit it - but he has tainted my entire view of how business is done in the Gulf Countries. Which is such a shame."

Thought I'd talk about something that went wrong and how when a business treats their employees with respect, humanity and care, alot of the time, employees are more than happy to work things through rather than have to fight and stop the company playing games with them.

I recently started a new job at a pet store, and the company is just amazing. Full transparency, incredibly kind, humble managers and regionals. Never pressured to overwork, have incredible training (for once) and the working environment is calm and nice.

Recently, there was an issue with getting my pay to me at the end of the month because of a miscommunication between managers about sending some documents off. So I won't be paid this month, it'll be the following month.

I get an email today from my manager, apologising and telling me she really cares. If I cannot get through this month or I really need the money, she would try and set up some emergency payment or something like that. Kindness, respect and apologies.

If this was my last job, I would've told them absolutely not, and gone to higher ups, because they treated me like crap. 

Knowing that this is an honest mistake, that my manager is so sorry and was even willing to help me get some emergency funds, talk to whoever I needed, it makes me feel valued.

They have told me they'll be adding a bonus to my next pay also to make up for the error. (£500+).

It would mitigate the ability for a lot of these places to pretend they didn't know someone couldn't work legally (Arguably depending on the situation it could even work as coverage with proof that the state made a mistake)

Since it would likely include any information you'd like to include for the purposes of fair hiring (Disability, age, gender, ect.) it would allow for certain pings to pop up for a company that may need investigation.

Make sure they're actually hiring people or be subject to fines among closure of business if it proceeds past a certain point. The ghost job situation is drastically doing real damage to our economy.

I know a lot of people are against the idea of Gov. stepping in on things and I am indeed included in that. However when you're talking about things that only exist on paper as far as consequences go (Businesses where excs. fuck up and never go to jail or see a pay cut, only the company loses money) it seems to be the main answer to that."

The trend underscores the seriousness of the declining birthrate and highlights the urgent need for the government to implement measures to revitalize regional areas.

Solution: New Law that all parents of children under 12 and pregnant women can work a maximum of 40 hours a week, get four weeks vacation, can't be paid less, and if fired must be replaced by another parent

I thought I was going to make an impact on these children and teach them things but instead I’m trying to get through every second of the day without crying. The other assistant teacher in the room ignores me half of the time I’m there. I say “good morning!” To her in an enthusiastic voice and she says “morning” in a very monotone voice as if she doesn’t want to say good morning to me at all. I just want to go home. I don’t care if I’m getting paid $20 an hour anymore. I’m sacrificing my own mental health for this job.

Decent bosses, I make $21 an hour and live within my means but I am still struggling/living paycheck to paycheck and I simply cannot keep up anymore. 

I suffer from PCOS, which made me develop pre diabetes. I also have severe ptsd from chronic homelessness/no support systems and being a victim of several forms of abuse. 

Despite being healthy and active, going to the gym after work sometimes, I have noticed an extreme decline in my ability to even function regularly at work. My body is giving out on me at only 26. I am burnt out. I feel hopeless because my ""savings"" is slowly draining. 

I live within my means and there is nothing more I can cut from my spending aside from going to the laundromat twice a month instead of once a week. Or maybe dropping my gym membership. But I need it to keep myself sane, if and when I end up homeless again I will need it to keep myself clean.

I cannot even afford to fix my truck anymore & I worry that I will have to sell it. But also if I end up homeless I kindof need that to live in. But I can't live in it if I cannot afford to keep it registered, insured, and operational.

I called out today because my pcos is causing me extreme pain, lethargy. And my boss made me dig trenches in the pouring rain while he just watched the entire time. 

I dont own a rain jacket. Cant afford one, wasnt offered one. I feel awful and sick today from 4 hours of manual labor while it poured outside and I got all muddy. We usually dont even work in the rain so the fact that my boss made me do that felt like ""punishment"" for me calling out a lot last week due to illness/my medication and body making me sick. 

I am tempted to just give up entirley because there is no point in trying anymore. I have no family. I have no support. But I don't want to end up in a homeless shelter again where I will be beaten, robbed, and SA'd again. 

I don't do drugs. Don't spend much on anything. Its not fair.

A lot of things contributed to my becoming an alcoholic, but I can't deny that a large factor was the insurmountable hopelessness I felt in the face of ""wake up at 7am, get home at 6pm and do that 5 out of every 7 days until you die"". It led to a nervous breakdown in 2023 and my subsequent unemployment.

I've worked since I was 16 years old and developed a professional career in sales (20 hours a week alongside a full-time university degree, then full time). I was very good at my job, and had the good fortune to receive 1-to-1 training from some of the best in my field. It sucked and I hated it, but I pushed through because I was raised to believe that a strong work ethic and resulting success was a virtue. Survival was also a pretty good motivator.

I've done 70-hour weeks, grinded for deadlines, tried starting my own businesses and battled undiagnosed ADHD throughout that time. I was physically incapable of holding down a job over the last year and a half, and have lived off government support, but I am now fully capable of returning to work and have a moral obligation to support myself moving forward.

My question is what the hell do I do now? If I return to that same feeling of hopelessness, I'm going to burn out or kill myself - survival didn't even matter to me in the end. I can't go back to sales, and I'm too far out of my degree to have a shot at the professional career it originally qualified me for. With a year and a half of my CV essentially blank, my opportunities are going to be more limited than I'd like.

Has anyone found ways to mitigate that sense of futility, or has any suggestions for ways/considerations in moving forward?

20,2024-07-24,"hired as assistant educator, now given full class loads and denied promotion.",u/blackclementine,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eb2sjt/hired_as_assistant_educator_now_given_full_class/,antiwork,"I work at a non profit “maker space” that offers adult memberships to the space, and year round education programs for k-12. That means that during the school year we have schools field trip
To our space, or go to local schools and do small STEM classes. Other than that we have camps. Spring camp, summer camp, and some In between. I have been here for around 7 months. I have an associates degree and I have about 6 years experience in education (I’m 24). I was hired as an “assistant educator”. When I showed up for work, I soon found out I was the only one in the education department besides my boss. The two people who own the company are husband and wife. The “wife” (we’ll call her lily) is my boss and runs the education department. So it was literally just me and her. 


For months I worked on side tasks and kits and other things assisting lily. The program itself is very disorganized. When I got there they were months behind on everything. The storage where all the materials are is a fucking mess, you can’t find anything. They are always frazzled and stressed. I started doing the spring camp with her and field trips and assisting by making sure everything was always ready for the next day. As well as being there and helping carry out lessons and staying with the kids etc. fast forward, they ask me to start helping with the “summer camp” program for 2024. It’s 5 consecutive weeks, m-f 9-3. First I did schedules. Then I did outlines…. Then they asked me to lesson plan 5 weeks alone. Okay… fine.


I spent weeks doing their catchup and planning (in reality 7 weeks) of camp since we had some extra programs before summer started. We start the first official week and on Friday my boss lily throws her hands up and says “you’re on your own after this. I’m not leading any more classes” I was confused and thought she was exaggerating but nope.


Come week 2, I am completely alone. With 20+ kids aged 7-11. I have been so fucking stressed w these kids (SORRY… they’re getting worse as the years go on) that I had an ocular herpes break out, then got a respiratory infection. Every day I’ve been breaking out in stress rashes on my thighs and arms. 


One day I ask her to help me locate some materials (which they never fucking do on time for me. I don’t have a company card or access to order materials so I have to HOPE they will order my materials for class on time)
My boss lily, fucking goes off on me. She says “YOU should have all these things prepared ahead of time!!!! No one helped me!” When I’ve been the only one who has planned this thing out to a T and had no idea she would be unloading this entire program
On me alone. SIDE NOTE: I don’t have a schedule. They never made one for me. They just tell me what time to come in, like word of mouth thing. And back on week one, she passively goes “hey what time
Is good for you to come in?” And I say… uh.. the normal time I guess? And she drops a bomb on me saying she needs me to stay until 5:30 every day to do the aftercare for the kids who don’t get picked up at 3. So in her words “if I want” I can come in at 10 instead”. No real meeting or sit down just some “idk if you want” conversation,

So I start coming in at 10 on some days since I live far away and I have to take public transportation. It takes me 1.5 hours on bus one way. 


Back to her tantrum, when she yelled at me she goes “and YOU CANT JUST SHOW UP WHEN YOU WANT!” I was like “you told me to come in at 10 and today and the day before I’ve been here since 8:30. How is that an issue I’m here earlier than when you told me?” And she said, verbatim, “because it means I’ll HAVE TO PAY YOU MORE.” Lol.


So I’ve been doing this dance now for about 4 weeks. I’m stressed, I’m tired. My days are work-bus-sleep. I’m dealing with a ton of defiant kids. I was speaking to my mom recently and telling her they gave me the whole class and have been telling me im now leading the program and it’s whatever I want. She goes “oh are they paying you more?” And it hit me. It’s like I remembered again I am
Still under “assistant”.


So I go to my boss the next day. Not lily, but her husband, we’ll call him Mike. I told Mike since I’m the one running the program solo now does that mean I’m getting promoted out of the assistant position? He winced in embarrassment. He cringed. Couldn’t look me in the eye and said “oh um… I mean you are assisting becuase you’re helping us out with doing the education stuff. If we made you a lead you’d need a masters degree and be running multiple programs at once.” I felt fucking humiliated. Like that’s not fair or makes any sense. 


Anyway. I’m stuck now, here. Had to accept my fate. I feel played and embarrassed for even asking. I feel like it’s not even accurate because I have 2 paid interns working below me ASSISTING me in my lessons sporadically. Just. I need help/advice. Is that right? Should I just stfu and keep working?? "

I can’t help but feel like I’m being completely screwed when asked to travel on my own dime. Not to mention, the IRS does not allow commission employees to write off expenses anymore if they are paid via W2 so double screwed.

There have been times I’ve been asked to attend in person meetings that require me to fly (or alternatively a 7 hour drive), and if I cite any “it’s expensive” lines I get offered to stay at a coworkers home which frankly I just DO NOT want to do when I’m already away from my family for work. I need my unplug and disconnect time.

The other piece to this is being 100% commission they cannot regulate your hours, but there is the expectation that you are always “on.” So a travel day eats into your work day and then you are expected to catch up on all the work you didn’t do.

Been there three years.  I refuse to work overtime.  My last raise was shit.  Manager tried talking to me today about taking on more work/responsibility with the incentive of “Hey, I know we fucked you on your raise in March, but if you take on more work, we’ll give you just a smidge more money.”  I said no.  Life is too short.

I’ve been with my company for almost three years.  I’m college-educated and I’m about to be 39.  It’s a decent job, hybrid, and I WFH Thursdays and Fridays.  I’m on salary, my pay is pretty decent for what I do, but the first year I had an employee review, I was given over a $2 raise, and earlier this year (March) during my employee review, I was only given a $0.72 raise.  I also never stay late, but I do tend to sign on or show up a few minutes before my shift.  Since then, I have completely changed my work habits.  I don’t chit chat with anyone (people at your job are not your friends), keep my headphones in all day and stay in my own bubble, and complete all my work in a timely fashion.  I don’t hate my job, but I also don’t love it.  It’s just a paycheck, really, while I figure other things out.

So this morning my boss asks me if she can speak with me privately a little bit later.  Of course, I suffer from diagnosed panic disorder and anxiety, so I tell her that telling an anxious person that you want to talk to them “later” is a terrible thing to do, and can you please just tell me what it is.  She says she wants to speak privately so my coworker doesn’t hear, and that it’s nothing bad, nothing about my work performance, but that it is regarding work.

Fast forward: We talk for about an hour, and she asks me where I see myself with the company in the future and my future in general.  Since I’m working on being more authentic in my life, I told her I really don’t think about the future — particularly because I’ve experienced so much loss in my life that I really can’t and don’t want to.  She mentioned that I was unhappy with my raise, and I said yes, and then she proposed that if I wasn’t too overwhelmed with my current work load (I am, but I manage), that I could take on more responsibility and possibly get another raise.  Yeah, no.  I outright told her I was fine in the position that I was currently in, that I have no interest “at this time” to grow or take on more responsibility, and that I’d like to just keep doing what I’m doing.  She said it was fine, but repeatedly mentioned that her and my big boss just think I “work so fast” so I can take on more responsibility.  🙄  I actually do work fast, but I work at half the speed I can to do my current work load, because I don’t want more work to be given to me — mainly other people’s work, which I also expressed that I no longer wanted to be given to me, since that’s what happens when you work fast.  So I told her that I’d like to stop being given that reputation, and that I just work normal and efficiently.

Anyway, yeah, I just came here to vent.  I think it went well.  I think she was disappointed, though.  😂"

On Monday 7/22 around 10:30am, I fell at work directly onto my left knee and onto my outstretched left arm. When I hit the ground, my arm locked up and sent a shooting pain up my arm to my shoulder. It was sore immediately after but I figured it would go away after a few hours. For context, I’m an estimator at a body shop so half my day is spent at my desk writing estimates and the other half is outside/in the shop inspecting damaged vehicles.
By 1:30pm I was really concerned because my arm was still pretty swollen and I couldn’t straighten it or fully bend it, so decided to go to the ER. My manager was out sick so I texted her a brief description of my fall and what was hurting and that I was heading to the hospital.
It turns out I have a minor fracture and fluid pockets around my elbow (my knee stopped hurting about 15 minutes after I fell) They splinted my arm from my fingers up to my shoulder and told me to get a follow up X-ray in a week to see if the fluid was dissipating and if I gained mobility back in my arm. They said if it hadn’t, they will give me a cast for 4-6 weeks. They gave me a letter saying I was cleared to return to work on 7/29, and the number for an orthopedic surgeon to follow up with within 4-5 days but I called them and they said they don’t deal with any workers comp claims and that I would need to wait to get an approved list of doctors from my job’s insurance company.
I’m trying to figure out the process of filing a claim but the info online is pretty confusing and just keeps bringing up attorney’s websites. My biggest concern is making sure my medical bills are covered (I don’t currently have insurance) and that I get reimbursed for the time I’m off work. I have 2 young children and have some pretty expensive bills coming up, I’m in California so my rent is ridiculous.
My manager doesn’t seem to know the process because she’s never dealt with it before. I texted her to ask if I would be reimbursed for my time off and she initially said she thinks it depends on how long I’m off for. Then she told me to see if my company’s short term disability would cover it. I looked into that and it seems that’s just for non-work related injury or illness that workers comp won’t cover. I texted her this morning to let her know that and she said she should have a claim number to send me later today and that she will give me the number for someone in HR to help me move forward with this process.
Does anyone have experience with this, and if so, what should my next step be?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm just in a real mood right now because I have put in a dozen applications to various jobs I absolutely am qualified for, but I have either been rejected, ghosted, or outright ignored on all of them.  I don't know why.  I can guess, at least 2 of the jobs that ghosted me did so after asking me my desired salary, to which I stated their top end offer (both were $20 an hour, both manager positions at retail stores) based on needing a living wage and my 10 years experience.  One of them tried to haggle me down to $14 an hour before ghosting me.  The others I don't know.  I've come to the conclusion that there needs to be a government database hat all businesses are required to submit employment data to, every time someone applies for a job the company should be required to list the application and if they end up not hiring the company should be required to give a reason why.

Not only would this help make employment practices much more publicly visible, but it will also shut up everyone who keeps spouting the ""no one wants to work anymore"" line.  Exame:  Company A over here passed over 200 applicants, but claims no one wamts to work, so... Maybe the issue isn't that no one wants to work, and it's that the company is just shitty?


Anyways.  Back to filling out applications thst will get binned by an AI Because I want a living wage.  No, I'm not joking, one of the jobs asked me if I would grant permission for an AI to look over my resume to determine if I was suitable, I declined and was instantly rejected.  A fucking COMPUTER rejected me for not letting an AI look my resume over.  We live in the worst timeline."

It is interesting because it shows how the job market hasn't really improved all that much and during the entire time they barely survived. It even showed where presidents were patting themselves on the back saying they made more jobs, people have more money, etc. But it shows reality is 100% different. Basically those on the lowest end of the ladder bounce from low paying job to low paying job.  They were NEVER able to work themselves out of poverty.

I'm a Southeast Asian freelancer working as a CS for a Chicago-based 'cleaning platform.' I just found out that very recently, they started paying out agents at a base rate of $3 per hour while tenured agents are paid eithee $5-6 depending on their tenure (usually getting upskilled or being an agent for 6+ months get that $1 raise). I'm a newbie so I'm judt getting paid $3 an hour and the only way to increase my pay is by performing with a near impossible standard especially for newbies. Such as completing 40 'tasks' MINIMUM per day while also avoiding every mistake. We're also on the job for a minimum of 48-50 hours per week, but 4-5 hours of those are unpaid lunch breaks. On top of that, Tenure/high performing agents are given mandatory OT's ranging from 5 to 15 hours of mandatory and max of 25 hours if an agent would choose to.



But I recently found out that regardless of tenure, the agents getting paid $5-6 face a huge risk of being brought down to also just $3/hr if their performance are deemed belpw satisfactory for 2 consecutive months. Imagine getting your pay cut in half regardless of the value you brought the company for YEARS. As absurd as it is, the people from my country are just naturally timid and more often than not, the risk of losing a job means starvation and having your kids leave school, which is why I doubt a union will ever be created.



Unsurprisingly, plenty of tenure AND high performing agents just left immediately and the company is currently facing a very low quality support and high 'task' backlogs. Newbies being paid this low, and tenures facing risk of getting their pay halved without consideration screams lower agent motivation and satisfaction and very high turnover rate."

The business is not doing super well due to market trends (less people drinking beer, higher prices, all the usual) but also due to a series of really stupid decisions on the owner’s part (too many to list and don’t necessarily want to give too many identifying features of the biz for obvious reasons).

Yesterday at our quarterly staff meeting, after our manager spent about 10 minutes going on about how much better we’re doing in sales compared to last year, she promised us a “summer staff party” to thank all the people that will be leaving at the end of the summer. The catch? It’ll be at the park down the road (free venue) and she wants it to be a POTLUCK. Like, we bring our own food. 

So basically they want to throw us a party, but for the cost of the provided beer (it costs roughly 83c to make a pint) and our labour and money for bringing food to feed our coworkers.

I’m likely not going; me and some coworkers have speculated that any budget underage will go straight into her pocket. Great management."

Warning, this is going to be a long post, I'll try to be as direct and forthcoming as possible. At this point, I don't know what to think about myself, what to think about life, or what the answers to my problems are, but right now I'm just really sick of everything. I'm so lost and so tired of going through my problems to the point that it mentally hurts. I'm just so, so tired of everything and all of my problems and failures are really starting to make me mentally and emotionally sick, destroying my sense of self. I have a very hard time being stable or consistent with anything, and one of the most biggest problems I have in life is keeping a job. I've been fired from a countless amount of jobs over the many years for different reasons. I have nowhere to turn anymore, no one to really talk to, and I'm just really trying to find some answers or solutions. I truly think something is wrong with me at this point. Alot of the problems I have, I've had throughout my entire adulthood life. I currently don't have a counselor.



Very recently, I just got fired from a job that I actually loved and cared about that I only worked at for 3 months. It was a warehouse job driving powered equipment and moving product and it was a very physically demanding and very busy, very active job. I put my entire efforts and energy into this job, trying real hard to do well, have a good performance, and get alot of products done. I would come home extremely exhausted and fatigued from work everyday. But at the same time I LOVED this job, the work I was doing, the way that this particular warehouse functioned, the people and managers there, the pay was really good, literally everything. Even while being at work I would usually feel really good about myself and very positive. And just like the large amount of jobs that I've had before this one I've been fired from this job, and now I feel worse than I ever have. Ever since this job that I most recently got fired from I've been doing ALOT of very deep self reflecting.



My work weeks were rough. My schedule was 7:00 AM - 3:00 PM, Monday through Friday which means I would have to start waking up as early as 4:45 AM - 5:00 AM to start getting ready, I had to take busses to get to work so I would have to leave the house as early as 5:55 AM to be there by 7:00 AM. Work at 7:00 AM - 3:00 PM, take the bus back home and get home around anywhere between 4:15 PM - 4:30 PM and this my work routine Monday - Friday. I'm 34 years old, so obviously this is not my first full time job and I've had tons of warehouse jobs before this and I've worked many different types of jobs. I've had a countless amount of jobs working a wide variety of either different schedules or schedules that were the same or similar as this one. I don't know what it is, but this last job I had got me thinking certain thoughts or having certain problems that I didn't have working other regular 40 hour work week jobs. Like for example, my work week is a standard 40 hours, 8 hour shifts. Why the hell do I feel like I'm working 60 hour work weeks or more like 12 hour shifts? Why do I start to feel the more and more as time goes on or the longer I stay at this job that I need more personal time away from work or more personal space or get the feeling that a 5 day work week is just too excessive or too overwhelming or I need something that breaks up the monotony of the work week? And I'm not someone who wants to be lazy or unemployed or not have work ethic either. Why does the time I have when I'm not at work during Monday through Friday always feel so damn limited or go by so damn fast, and sometimes even the next day feels as if it comes around too fast? These were the biggest problems that I had on this most recent job, and during the whole 3 months I worked there, these problems NEVER got any easier, including up to the last week that I worked there. There's no way to give yourself more time or add more time to the day even when you really want and need more time, that's both when you come home from work and when you wake up the next morning to get ready for work.



The problems I've had while working this job didn't even have to do with the actual job itself or actually being at work itself, but more like everything that surrounds the job or everything that comes with the work week and the weekly routine of this job. One of problems I've had while working this job is my time off of work. Time always felt so extremely limited Monday through Friday when I'm not at work. I would come home from work and always be so drained and so tired to the point where I really can't do anything productive or anything overly interesting or anything that requires alot of mental effort, and this would include doing things that are as simple as watching a TV show. Just extremely tired and fatigued. Not all of my days would be like this, but I've had many days where I would come home and it's like I have no energy for anything else at all, and I'm really just not interested in doing anything. I would lay around in bed, sometimes being able to sleep, sometimes not, and I would do this for a few hours and usually after that I would still be tired and then after awhile it's like ""Well, I don't want to spend my ENTIRE time off work laying in bed or sleeping without doing anything"" so I would get up and try to do things that are enjoyable or things that are more into my own interests and hobbies but everytime that happens it's already going into some late night hour where midnight is fast approaching, but yet when midnight comes around, I have to start waking up by 4:45 AM - 5:00 AM so I have time to get ready to catch the bus. It's always until some late night hour or closer to midnight when I start feeling like ""myself"" and the tiredness and fatigue wears off and I start having the interest or inspiration to get into my interests.



Getting up in the morning and trying to get ready and trying to catch the bus would be a HUGE problem, and I mean a HUGE fucking problem. All my life, even as a kid, I've always struggled with time or being places on time, ESPECIALLY if it's a job that starts early in the morning. It's always the same shit everyday, and alot of mornings it would just become downright annoying. Wake up early in the morning before the sun even comes up, and time is going by fast as hell, minutes go by more like seconds. I'm running around the house stressed, trying to get ready, get all my stuff together, eat a good breakfast and leave for work. I've had many days of not being able to catch the bus on time, so if I'm about to miss the bus, and 5:55 AM comes around and I'm still not ready or still nowhere near able to run out the front door and catch the bus, it's like ""Screw it I'm tired of stressing myself out about this, I'll just take the rest of my time getting ready and call an Uber"" and even then sometimes I would still be late to work. I got fired from work because of attendance and being late too many times. I would find myself wishing more and more that my job had a later start time like 9:00 AM or so, hell even 8:00 AM just one hour later would really make things easier or would be a more reasonable time considering the type of work I'm doing and the physical activity of it. Getting to work always felt like a huge hassle and a huge inconvenience whether I'm on time or not. Getting to work on time always felt like an accomplishment. This problem never got any easier as time went on or the longer I stayed at this job, in fact, quite the opposite. The more and more I stayed with this job, the more and more harder it felt to keep up with this weekly routine, and the more and more harder it became to be at work on time. The most recent few weeks I worked at this job I was late 2 or 3 times a week. Some days I would be late for work and I would tell myself ""Don't be late again, try real hard to be on time tomorrow"" and sometimes even the very next day it's still the same problem, still the same shit all over again and I might be late again the very next day even after telling myself and making promises to myself to not to be late again.



Another problem that I really have is just becoming angry and frustrated, and this has happened many times before over the years, and at many different jobs. Sometimes this happens for reasons to where I know the reasons why I feel this way whether it be about the job itself or other things outside of the job that don't have to do with job or work, other times for reasons where I don't know the reasons why. But this almost always happens, just this deep feeling of anger and frustration or resentment. But sometimes when I'm working a job and I've been there for awhile I just start getting extremely unhappy about life overall or start to get this overwhelming sense of the only reason why I'm living or the only purpose I have is just to work or I'm just getting up and going to work and busting my ass and meanwhile everything else in life is so extremely unfulfilling, dull, or even pointless, and weeks start to feel very monotonous, like every week is always the same week, or I start wishing that life was different in some ways, somehow. Sometimes when I wake up I'm just automatically angry. I can't even help it, it's just automatic. This even happened on occasions on this most recent job I had, the same job I really wanted to do well at and keep. And this time around when these thoughts and feelings would come up I would recognize it and be more aware of it because I had already gone through this problem so many countless times throughout my life. This might be going alittle off topic and this might be a separate conversation, but outside of working a job I'm good at, my biggest passion and biggest purpose in life has always been music, and that's something I've known or something I've been ever since I was a little kid. I'm actually very big into writing full blown music compositions, music productions, and playing and writing music for piano, and being a solo music artist/songwriter. And just like everyone else who's a musician I've always had dreams of becoming famous or at least semi-famous or semi successful and I want to be someone who performs alot or someone who really gets alot of recognition for what I do. It may seem off topic that I'm mentioning this but the only reason why I'm mentioning this here is because I found it damn near impossible to have the motivation, drive, desire, or energy to practice and work on my music when I wasn't at work. As in, working on my music felt like doing too much work and effort just like going to work is doing alot of work and effort, so an overwhelming majority of the time the last thing I would want to do is practice or work on music or work on my musical goals after a long day/week of work, but at the same time, I get unhappy about that because I'm not working on my music. But it's like I'm too tired or too depressed or frustrated to even care. But not caring or not doing what truly makes me who I am makes me very depressed and for some reason I could never get the motivation or inspiration to work on my music or even work on myself. It's extremely conflicting.



I truly think something is really wrong with me at this point. I know I've already said this many times but this is a job I really wanted to have, really cared about, really wanted to do well at and not just do well at my job, but start doing well in life overall, or start having and working towards a more meaningful, fulfilling life and start working on so many personal goals so this hurts in a totally different way. I tried so hard to manage my thoughts, recognize my problems, and have a positive outlook and do well at work. What pisses me off about this is if this job wouldn't have fired me, I wouldn't have quit because I was going to be dedicated, whether I had a hard time waking up or getting to the job or not, I was going to stay there just like everyone else stays at or keeps their good jobs without ever having an issue. Being unemployed and looking for another job and not knowing what the hell is going on really sucks right now, and this is not what I wanted. I've been through this too many times. I don't want a different job, I wanted to keep working at where I was already at and have some damn stability, and just worry about and focus on my LIFE and my personal goals and self improvement, not worry about what I'm doing for work or money. I'm always doing so bad at life or always at the bottom. Constantly not being able to keep a job and constantly being fired has very obviously caused alot of very bad situations or very bad financial problems or always the constant stress of being broke, not having money, or not being able to do anything.



Everyone else around me or everyone else I know in real life is always doing well, living their own lives always bragging about how good their job is or how proud they are of themselves, always getting and having bigger and better things in life, new apartments/houses, new cars, always buying expensive shit or spending alot of money on stuff, taking trips and vacations regularly, getting into relationships, etc, there is an upwards progression with everyone else, things always get bigger and better. Meanwhile here I am at 34 with really no accomplishments, nothing to show off or brag about, no job to be proud of, and always doing bad, always going broke or running out of money like what the fuck is wrong with me and why am I not a functioning adult, or why are these things so difficult for me but for everyone else it seems to come so easily? Why do things about life or the way certain things work always seem to bother me but literally no one else? I only seem to think about or notice certain things that no one else does. Why is it so hard for me to just find and do something that works and do well at it just like everyone else? At my age and after so many failings I really don't even know what to think about myself or think about life anymore, I am so lost. I don't have my own life going for me and this is ruining my sense of self. I'm truly scared for my future both short term and long term and I am running out of hope fast. I'm just seeing if anyone has any advice or any similar experiences or if anyone could relate or have some answers. Thanks."

They very regularly send me clients outside of this and I either turn them down or offer to see them clustered with another client that I had begrudgingly accepted for the same reason before, lol. 

Of the referrals I receive I probably have only taken half… but if they had followed me criteria I’d have taken so many more. 

Anyways, I feel like I’m a “difficult” person for them to deal with for this reason, but I also make concessions that I hate making to begin with. No idea if this is fair of me or if I’m supposed to be making more of an effort to accept work that comes my way. I just don’t find it fulfilling spending unpaid hours in traffic on the bus going to the edge of town, and all that time adds up to hours and hours of this.

How is that different than what's happening now with the elites taxing us to oblivion while they live off our labor? What is stopping us? Russians and French were able to pull up and change their country for the better. 

If any change ever happens now its from Americans themselves as we are the most armed country on the planet. Further the entire planet looks up to us we are a prime examples for change whether it be good or bad. It's time we get off our asses and form local groups in real life and seek out other discouraged rent a slaves who want to make a difference.

 Whining and complaining isnt gonna change anything.  Seek out a group in your local area decide to take action and then further link with other groups in ur nearby towns we need to form minute men type of late 1770s army that is willing to defend the working people all across the planet. Id look on college and university campuses as they tend to have the most left leaning people to start with. 

The owner class have trampled on us for too long we don't even have worker rights and unions are shut down and have no teeth. It's practically worse than slavery since many workers cannot afford to feed,house and clothes themselves. We must resist and assist or we are next.✊"

I do have some hobbies but I never seem to be able to get past thinking of them as things I do in my free time rather than who I am. My work identity feels a lot more solid but I'd honestly rather care about it less because I work as a cog in a large corporate environment and would rather not get so frustrated when things don't go my way. I hate feeling bothered by work so much when a lot of it is completely pointless.

I guess I feel scared that if I focus so much on things outside of work that I'll possibly forget about my job and get fired or lose money or something? I'm not sure. Either way, there seems to be this psychological tether that keeps me thinking about it more than I should and having stronger emotional responses to things than I want to.

Now, I have a story worthy of Antiwork to share with you.

My idiot manager wrote me up today for taking breaks. Here's the thing, he conflates going to the bathroom with taking a break. He literally tried to tell me I took 20 minutes taking a leak.

He also tried to tell me that I take 20 30 minute breaks in a day. That's 600 minutes which is 10 hours. That's basically my entire shift time. It was, but we just switched to 12 hour days. He told me to go home after I called him out on this, and I demanded it in writing. His excuse was ""production"". He then told me that I wasn't going to get paid for the time I worked. I demanded that in writing he told me to go home.

He then wrote in an emailed write up that I take too many breaks. Not bathroom breaks, but to many breaks. Oh and that I have a bad attitude and argued with him about it. So I sent a lengthy email in response. HR was CCed and links from OSHAs site, and an OSHA certified trainer website completely destroying his argument. Both describe how bathroom breaks work.

Now here's the thing. I probably urinate 4-5 times in a ten hour shift. Sometimes less if I am doing heavy labor and sweat the liquids out. At 5 minutes a pop, or less, thats 20 minutes tops. That includes time to get to the bathroom and back.  Sometimes I take a number two for 10 to 15 minutes. Sometimes I don't, and yet he keeps not understanding a break vs a bathroom break.

Now here's the thing too. We work outside in the heat so we all have to drink extra liquid. We used to be able to just urinate outside, but we have a female on the crew now and were told we have to use the Portajohns. Plus there's a chance that the public might see us if we urinate outside. This might lead to a possible indecent exposure charge if someone calls the cops.

I think my employer might be screwed. Antiwork is the future.

Oh also this is in a work field I have 5 years of deep experience in. I've done basically everything there is on a job site.

So, my employer might be screwed."

""Give a man a fish, he'll be hungry in an hour, teach him to fish, he'll never starve again"" 

There are many version of this, but the idea is all the same 

If someone is struggling in our society, giving them some food and nothing else is neglectful.


My grandma brags about volunteering at the very type of services I've had to use when I was homeless, 

Most of us more intelligent homeless guys, the ones that don't stay homeless, we don't use those services. 

The guys who stay homeless do. 


This is because those services do nothing but trap them in a cycle, 

Shelters with 2 inch thick books of rules, curfew times, and chores preventing them from finding flexible work or improving their personal lives 


Witnessing how those people were treated, while being on the same social level as them. 

I was disgusted and made my announcement of the obvious mistreatment, and the fact that I'd be better off taking naps in a bush while I look for work and money. 


Now anti work. I've seen this quote twisted here too and it's disgusting, 



You guys aren't anti work, you just don't know what it's like to work somewhere that isn't trying to squeeze you. 


A job is still just being handed fish right? 



But the fish goes beyond just jobs. 



Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, 


If we want a less corrupt society,  you're gonna have to learn how to fish. 

You're gonna have to then sacrifice much of your leisure lifestyle to create a better environment for others 




I know those of you not working at very privleged to be living comfortably at home without consequence, but there is a bigger war to be fought. 





For as long as this ancient quote has helped people, it follows that ""those living in a high class of society would often be inconvenienced by the act of teaching a man to fish. They will always expect someone else to do it for them"" 

Does that last sentence not sound familiar on our modern society? Surrounded by people who are aware of every problem, but waiting for someone else to help? 


The existence of these charities and services are enough to make you feel good? 


They keep people dying and take your donations :( 

I know people struggling, I've seen death. I've traced the cause to corruption, 

I've taken the time, sacrificed my happiness, to find out why there is so much suffering around me, 

I can't be happy if society is struggling 




I don't think you guys are anti work, I think you just want to be treated as human 

It's human to burn out, not be productive 24/7, it's human to take your time.  

We just gotta, stand up for what's right, you guys can't hide at home or roll over onto the streets. 


I want to end corruption not hide from it. 


Thank you for reading. I hope you'll spend more time learning skills, and sharing these activities with your local community, 

Giving feels good, teaching feels great "

I’m tired of pretending and everyone being two-faced, acting and manipulating to get what they desire. Why can’t we just be left alone to our work and then go home ? 

I’m tired of acting like this is “normal” and that’s “the way she goes” this isn’t normal and we are being exploited. 

I’m tired of listening to everyone bitch and complain, yet do nothing to change their situations. It’s emotionally draining and it has affected my mental health greatly.

I’m tired of being tired of this place, and all work for that matter. It is not natural, late stage capitalism is KILLING US. 

Even now, as I write this I’m sitting on break, going on about 2 hours now. Hoping the boss notices, comes out and fires me . This isn’t “normal” and I fear the longer I stay the closer I get to the grave.

To those who have took the leap and left, how did you build the courage to do so? I can’t escape my comfort zone. The fear of the unknown is paralyzing me. I am tired and just needed to vent, I will be alright. Thanks to those who read and listened to me cry about first world problems.

1. THIS IS A RANT. Stop now if you don't want your time wasted. 

2. I think we have all been there, so don't think you haven't had these exact thoughts.

3. Yes, I know boomers are going to want to retaliate to this post. Just know this, I don't expect something for nothing and I don't think anything will be handed to me. We all know that back in your day, a person just needed drive and gumption to get a job. Now you're just gatekeeping jobs that almost anyone could do with ease. SO PLEASE RETIRE ALREADY SO WE CAN HAVE YOUR EASY JOBS. If you want to prove me wrong, convert a word document to a PDF and then back.

4. I rewrite my entire resume to match the job description and use ATS analysis. I have had several colleagues and resume builders look over my resume. So no, it's not my resume.

5. Yes, I have taken the skills tests offered by company's and aced them. Still no word. Hmm....maybe my perfect score intimidated them. Well NEWS FLASH, I am coming for your job.

6. I am not talking about specialized industries (doctor, lawyer, engineer, some trades, etc.). This is aimed at the jobs with titles such as; Account Managers, Project Scheduler, Account Executives, Fulfillment Leaders, Help Desk (I, II, or III), Data Entry Specialist (like wtf is a data entry specialist? Someone who is special and can enter data?), Business Development Rep, and so on.

I hate that I am turned down for jobs that pay really well that someone without a brain could do. If you really think a job is complex, look up the definition of the job. You'll be dumbfounded that you were turned down. I don't understand when a company says, ""We do not think you have the qualifications for this job"" aka ""We have decided to pursue....blah blah blah"". Most jobs are not hard. They are made out to be hard. Unless it's a specialized field, YOUR JOB ISN'T HARD. I think most people want to feel special and needed, so they exaggerate the job.

Job experience on a resume is a waste of time. Employers lie on job descriptions/requirements and applicants lie or at least exaggerate on resumes. Resumes are a literal waste of time. They are the same idea and level of importance as a popularity contest in high school. Also, recruiters or those who are reading your resume have no intelligence. They can't make the connection between a previous job in a different industry and see the transferable skills. You have to spell it out for them. ATS is no different. It's actually worse. Would making a cops robots make sense? How about a therapist? Then neither should the person who reads resumes. They need a (intelligent) human element to reason and read between the lines to see the connections.

I really want to just put these 3 lines on my resume,

1. Yes, I can do the job I am applying for. I wouldn't be here if I knew I couldn't.

2. GIVE THE LITERAL F'N DEFINITION OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS BECAUSE RECRUITERS AND ATS OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW IT.

3. List of my certs because they should be worth something even without the x years of experience that you are requiring for an ENTRY LEVEL JOB.

Current methods show that a great resume and a super charismatic person with personal ties can get a dumb person a job, but an okay resume and an introverted person with no personal ties will leave the perfect candidate out... Is it not time to change hiring methods?! If they are truly worried about job turnover, then they should hire the person who is qualified, not the person that knew someone.

If you got this far and still want to retaliate like the little keyboard warrior you know you are, then go for it. You deserve it."

1,2024-07-24,I’m being setup to fail. ,u/Drakon519,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ebi8hk/im_being_setup_to_fail/,antiwork,"So at work, my team has been working on this new project since about March. Except for me. Despite us being a small team (only 3 devs), I was excluded from any and all work on the project. The only time I was ever involved, was when one of the other programmers (who has 20 years more experience than me) would reach out to get me to help him figure out how to do something basic. 

About 2 months ago, I was told I was not going to be able to take any PTO from about July until the beginning of October. One of my team members was given permission for an extended vacation/paternity leave. The other one made sure to book all his time off in July before he informed me (they don’t want more than 1 of us out at a time). 

On the 11th of this month, I was told I am now being put on the project, but only because of the vacations that are happening with my other two team members. And just my luck, next week their vacations overlap so I am left on this project by myself. 

Last Thursday was my first on-boarding call, but it really wasn’t. It was more them asking me  complex architecture questions, despite the fact it was my first time actually looking at this project. On Friday, I was given a second walk through, but it was really just the other dev pointing out all the issues in the project. On Monday, my first day actually on the project, I got to attend a demo where I actually got to see everything involved in this project so far. 

The next major problem: the code. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such bad code in my life, and all of it was written by a dev with 25+ years experience. Hundreds of console logging statements pushed into the main branch, with everything from object values, to his own name, to days of the week so he knew when he worked on them last, to absolute gibberish in them. Importing the same util file multiple times, with different names, and calling both of them. There is so much more, but I really don’t want to get into it. 

So here I am, first week on the project, I am the only one on my team who can do this part of the work (other dev who is still in the office doesn’t handle this kind of development). All the stories for the sprint are assigned to me, all the defects are getting assigned to me. I have no knowledge as to why things are architected are certain way, and next week I will be here all alone to look after all of that + handle anything on our main application should anything go wrong.

8,2024-07-24,We need more transparency and an option to appeal when AI is used in the hiring process,u/rsb_david,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ebi9m8/we_need_more_transparency_and_an_option_to_appeal/,antiwork,"Hello,

My position was terminated at the start of the year and I've spent the last 7 months job searching,  which has recently come to an end thankfully.  Now, I am not someone who applies for everything willy-nilly as I look to look into the company, the culture, and prepare a targeted resume and mock interviews in advanced.  This is the first time I've had to apply for a job in over a decade, so I was a bit rusty, but I was not expecting how different the process was.

During my search, I've observed posts on Reddit and heard personal stories from former coworkers where they would put hundreds of applications in and get ghosted, or denied automatically in seconds.  It isn't fair to have to wait and not hear back.  This happened to me as well and was frustrating to say the least.   I was able to get in contact with a few individuals who told me that their system denied me due to as few as one of the requirements listed not being met, even if it would accept other experience instead.  For example, one of the jobs declined me because I didn't have an active A+ certification, even though I have 15+ years of experience in IT doing much more advanced things and my A+ cert had expired.   This got me thinking about the idea of legislature that would address this.

I present to you – ""Hiring Integrity and Response Enhancement Act"" or ""HIRE Act"".   

*Note: this ironically was created with the help of AI to word things better as I suck at writing things professionally, however, the points and reasoning are my own.  I originally designed it for my state of Kentucky, but later realized that it is a nationwide problem that needs broader legislature.*


___


**Overview**

The proposed bill aims to improve transparency and fairness in the hiring process for job applicants in the United States. It addresses the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment and ensures candidates are treated with respect and fairness.

**Goals/Benefits**

1. Transparency
 * Candidates will know when AI is used and what data influenced decisions,
fostering trust in the hiring process.
2. Fairness
 * Provides candidates with a second chance for human evaluation, ensuring that
qualified individuals are not overlooked due to AI limitations or biases.
3. Improved Candidate Experience
 * Acknowledging all applications and providing clear communication reduces
stress and improves the overall job search experience for applicants.
4. Accountability
 * Encourages businesses to be more accountable for their hiring processes and
the technologies they employ.

___


**Section #1 - Response to Job Applications**

The purpose of this section is to ensure job seekers receive acknowledgement and closure, reducing uncertainty and frustration in the application process.

* All employers must provide a response to a job application, in written or electronic form, to every job application submitted, regardless of if the applicant is hired or not.

* The response must be provided within 30 days of application submission and must indicate the decision reached.

**Section #2 - Disclosure of AI usage**

The purpose of this section is to increase transparency and allows candidates to understand how their data is being used. 

* All businesses must disclose to applications if AI was used in any part of screening or hiring process.  

* The notification must include:
  * A clear statement that AI was used
  * A description of the data reviewed by AI
  * The outcome of the AI evaluation

**Section #3 - Right to Appeal AI-Based Decisions**

The purpose of this section is to ensure fairness by allowing candidates to have their applications reviewed by a human, mitigating biases or errors that might occur with AI algorithms.

  * If an applicant is deemed not a good fit by AI, they must be informed of their right to
appeal the decision.
  * Upon request for an appeal, the business must conduct a human review of the
applicant’s materials within 14 days.
  * The result of the human review must be communicated to the applicant within 30 days of
the appeal request

**Section 4 - Penalties**

* Businesses that fail to comply with this Act will be subject to fines determined by the Department of Labor

____


Overall, this improves transparency and respects candidates' time when applying for jobs. One question I was considering is how this would affect the HR workload at various companies.  As many companies do use third party systems in hiring, I feel most won't even notice the additional work it would take to notify people and it could likely be done automatically.  Local mom and pop shops and other small businesses who do paper-only applications might be the most impacted, but a 30 second phone call or text message even would suffice.   It also helps you know how your data is being used when applying for jobs, and could be augmented to indicate what data they used in the hiring decision too."

22,2024-07-24,Beware of this shady recruitment practices ,u/Beginning_Big4819,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ebiwnt/beware_of_this_shady_recruitment_practices/,antiwork,"I’m writing this post not only to vent my frustration but also to raise awareness about some dubious recruitment practices that I’ve recently encountered. I hope my experience can serve as a cautionary tale for job seekers and spark a discussion about the ethics of such practices. The company in question is Employment Hero. Since at least February this year, they have been periodically reposting the same job offer on LinkedIn. The title of the job might change slightly (from “Customer Operations” to “Customer Experience”), and the tasks might be shuffled around, but it’s essentially the same job. This job offer stays open for about three weeks, attracting hundreds of applicants each time. Then the job offer is closed, only to be reposted anew. This cycle repeats itself over and over. I wondered what their end goal was. Well, once you apply, they send you an email confirming receipt of your application. But here’s the catch: they ask you to download their new employment app, Swag, to track your application and keep in touch with the Hiring Manager. So yeah basically it's a switch and bait practice to get more App users. This practice is not only frustrating for job seekers who invest their time and effort into applying for these ‘ghost’ jobs, but it’s also ethically questionable. It’s disheartening to see companies treating job applicants as mere numbers, using job offers as a means to promote their products. I’m seriously appalled by this practice and I believe it’s high time we address such issues. Job seekers deserve respect and transparency during the recruitment process."

We're hollowing out our future workforce and pretending it's fine because Wall Street is happy. It's beyond short-sighted; it's downright destructive.

And let's talk about how we're subsidizing social programs in other countries (aid) while demonizing any attempt to help our own citizens. Ask for affordable healthcare or a decent safety net here, and you're branded an evil socialist. Meanwhile, our tax dollars are propping up welfare states around the globe, one is an apartheid ethnostate currently perpetuating a massacre of epic proportions, and the other is one of the most corrupt dictatorships to have ever existed, ironically being invaded by another fellow corrupt dictatorship. We’re footing the bill abd the only winners are the lords of war who are making billions. It’s infuriating.

Good luck to the next generation—they’re going to need it.

2,2024-07-25,I think I got my pay stolen from me but I’m not sure what to do. ,u/catofforgiveness,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ebm7gr/i_think_i_got_my_pay_stolen_from_me_but_im_not/,antiwork,"So I started a new job in September, I told them about the plans I had already made to travel. This new job only offers 10 days PTO whereas my old job offered 24. At this new job they have comp time and sick pay, so they told me I could gain comp time and use it to be able to go on my vacations. 

Anyways, I worked lots of events and got around 5 days of comp time! One of the policies is that we can use our comp time before anything, before sick time, before vacation time, anything. So when I was submitting my time sheets, I made sure to do that. 

However, I got pulled over and basically talked to in an aggressive tone saying I wasn’t allowed to do that and that I need to use my vacation time first. After that, I went to look at the employee policy book, but there was nothing mentioned in it regarding that, it was only verbally.

Fast forward to last month and they said that comp time always goes before vacation time no matter what. It’s now and writing and everything, so I have the proof here. How can I go about getting my vacation time back? I forgot to mention that my vacation time was about expire and I suspect that they didn’t want me to carry it over past the expiration date because then they would’ve had to pay me for it. I was actually going to use that time, I had a whole trip planned and everything and was disappointed when I found out that they didn’t let me keep the time. I also had those 5 days of comp time expire as well :/ 

I told my supervisor about it and she talked to our bosses and she defended me, to which they said that they would be willing to give me SOME of my comp time back (they didn’t mention vacation time, which I know that they know that’s what they took from me and owe me). What can I do? 

Oh also when I even asked to see the employee handbook they got really aggressive and we’re being rude and my boss even shoved me twice without apologizing. I made sure to at least document that via email. I’ve been avoiding them as much as I can because they’re old and rude boomers :/ "

I am 19. This is what happens when you have **NO** union and give employers **100%** of the bargaining power.

1st job: **Fired** in 1 week over $3 till shortage This one broke my heart for a long time.  **(7.75/hr)**

2nd job: **Fired** in 1 day (Laid off, had no room for any more workers) **($7.25+tip)**

At this point my self esteem was basically crushed because these were my first few jobs.

3rd job: 3 weeks. Seafood. **Fired**.  Manager wanted to hire me back because she can't find workers. Stop firing everybody! **($9/hr)**

4th job: Fired in 2 days. Subway sandwiches! **($7.25 an hour + tips)** that maybe got you up to $8. I couldn't even buy a sandwich.

At this point, you're probably like, ""what the fuck?"" I'm sure y'all might have something negative to say.

5th job: Worked at a pizza restaurant. **$10/hr**. Quit after 8 months b/c I wanted more hours + to move up.

6th job: **Fired in** 2 days. **$10/hr.** I was curious to how much someone else made and asked them. Fired at will the moment I left work. Fun! 2

7th Job: Delivery driving. Okay, this one was a little fun. At times. **$6.50/hr on the road pay, 35c/mile and $8/hr in store pay + tips.** Rarely, the pay was $20 an hour. Usually $10-13, less after gas.- Left due to sexual harassment by our clientele and manager. Manager offered to fk me after I quit lmao.. NTY

I work these currently:

8th job: Serving! Corporation. $2.13 but I can usually get at least to $13 with tips. Sometimes $20. Sometimes $25! My managers are nice, patient and encouraging.

9th job. Bartending! Locally owned. $8/hr. My manager sometimes slips me $100. He does that for all new workers. He is awesome and generous. I get $40-$50/hr in tips.

Do we notice a pattern here? I'm getting paid more to do less the more I get fired and the more I quit. I got the job I wanted after my parents tried to sway me against not leaving the pizza place. I'm able to get at least 40 hours a week working these two jobs.

No, I will not stop asking people how much they make. This is the corporate culture they try to scam us into to censor us into getting paid less. And nobody's trying to fuck me here! This is great!

 I received an approximately 300% pay increase just by getting fired. SO, thanks for firing me! "

I say how stupid it is that they're sick days, just add the week to our PTO and let us decide how to use that week. Basically if you're healthy you lose out on the week off, and sick people get more time off, and if you're seriously ill that week won't do you shit anyway.

Later caught the coworker making fun of how dumb I am for not knowing standard sick leave to my boss. Both were laughing but sort of look liked the boss was just going with it to fit in. I caught this on camera because we had a break in and equipment got stolen so I set up a webcam on my desk to always record with permission from the boss.

So anyway, I cleared one such exam and landed a job in a government owned bank and I think clearing that exam was the worst thing that happened to me. I mean it's not like I wanted that job, I gave the exam because I was preparing for a much harder one so clearing this exam was easy and I thought I will just get this job for now and prepare for my dream post later, simultaneously while doing this job so I will have a source of income.

But my dream has came crushing down since I am now made to work more than 10 hours a day I go to office at 9.45 am and there is no time of return the earliest I have left is at 8 pm, I usually leave around 8.30 and sometimes also stay till 9.30, not only that my boss also calls me on some Sunday's for a few hours and it's not like I am the only one other officers who work here work same or even more than me so I don't see the conditions improving in future as well.

All this has left me with frustration because as I originally planned I am unable to study for the job I want so I feel that I am capable of doing more but am not able to because of my own stupidity of taking this job.

I thought about quitting but the bank has made me sign a bond of a very high amount (nearly 4 months of my salary) for 3 years and even if I somehow managed to pay that amount, there is so much pressure from my family and friends, they say that people would kill to be in the position I am in and all that..... but they just don't understand or even try to understand my frustration, since due to high unemployment many people don't even have a job here. So well here I am doing something I never wanted and unable to quit and utilize my full potential.

I don't know what to do since even if I quit somehow it's not a guarantee that I will get the job I want, I just had to get this all out."

back in January they decided to do 8% company-wide layoffs that only affected managerial positions and up. when they told us this, they were literally fake crying and lovebombed us. it was such a weird experience. they said things like “we love you guys so much, but we have to do what we have to do” “we know theres been people with us for decades and we love you, but we have to let you go” “it hurts us so much to do this” all through some fake ass tears and sniffles. it made me feel even more icky than I already did working here. 

anyways, the layoffs lasted until JUNE. they were doing this to “improve efficiency” and “remove barriers to execution” meanwhile the suspense of everybody waiting to see if they were going to get the knife completely halted work for 4 fucking months. in the middle of May, my department was told that actually, for us, the layoffs are affecting staff too. it was down to me and a coworker, i’m still here (begrudgingly gratefully). it was a total blindside for our whole department. we were told 8% layoffs company wide, yet our department lost 20-30% of people JUST IN OUR COUNTRY. 

on top of the incredibly poor way they handle business, they uphold the attitude of being positive all the time! no matter what! yay! we love work and don’t want to have lives outside of this company!

thats not even the worst though — they prey on certain communities with false promises of making money. its genuinely scary and I hate being a part of this company.

Having a higher workload, more hours and performing above average should logically also grant you an above average life.

Instead of this most people work an amount of hours that they can barely handle, deal with high workloads, work themselves close to breaking point, and the end result? An average life.

I currently work a full time job that is almost a 50% pay cut from my last. I was laid off from my last job due to restructuring. I’ve been working since I was 12. I have no generational wealth, no assets, but I’ve always worked. I have nothing to show for it. I’m budgeting to my last dollar every month and am actually in the negative most times, working 40 hours a week and barely getting by. I’ve lost weight due to stress/food insecurity, but I am thankful I at least have been able to make rent (for now). I really hope that doesn’t change but losing my housing is always in the back of my mind.

What do I/we do to keep going? This is unsustainable, and it is so clear to me that even people who hustle 60+ hours a week are still one life event away from complete devastation. There must be something better than this. At the absolute bare minimum, why can’t people who work full time afford to live and have food and maybe even a fun thing here and there? (I know why in theory, but I’m just saying - how much suffering do we have to endure day-to-day ON TOP OF catastrophic historical events?)

It’s wild that I feel lucky to have three paid sick days available at work because I know folks who have none, but when I really think about it, it’s crazy to accept that as a privilege.

We’re a small staff of about 20. I work with a team of 2 other people on cat adoptions. My manager, team lead and I have noticed that our other coworker has been making some errors and not doing work to the level she should be. I brought that up to my manager thinking it would be addressed with her directly. I didn’t mention anything specific, just that I thought she might need some reminders or extra training. But now, my team lead (at the request of our manager) has asked me to make a log of all the mistakes I see from my coworker. This feels a little bit overboard to me and I’m not sure it’s particularly ethical. On the one hand, it is hard when things are not done properly and it makes all of our jobs harder especially in an already very stressful workplace. But on the other, I don’t want to give the managers reason to fire her. I have a small suspicion they might want to do so because they recently decided to hire 2 new people when I know we barely have the budget for one. Any thoughts?"

No she's not a famous wealthy actress; she works a regular job on the crew. The kind of crap I hear about in her industry is mind boggling. The way the industry is set up, it's rife with problems. All the power is held by a select few people and they're allowed to misbehave because in most cases, they aren't exactly replaceable. Getting jobs in this business is all word of mouth and referrals, so you can't get anyone in trouble or burn any bridges because you'll pretty much get blacklisted. Basically, the director and the main star can act like jerk, treat people like crap, violate safety rules and no one will report them because 1) you'll get fired, 2) no one will hire you again, 3) the studio isn't willing to jeopardize a financially successful production by firing the director because he called you a stupid c\*nt in front of 100 people (happened to my wife's co-worker), 3) if you try to sue, the billion dollar studio will bankrupt you by dragging you through infinite legal hurdles. It's no wonder monsters like Harvey were able to get away with their behavior for so long. My wife is like, meh, it's just the way it is and she knew what she was signing up for.

I’m a domestic cleaner meaning my uniform is part of my PPE, it’s a blue polo shirt with black trousers and my NHS badge. Wouldn’t it save the company money and improve morale if instead of making us wear uniforms (which they warn us may be inspected) they were to tell us to wear short sleeves and thick trousers we don’t mind getting damaged? Why do we have to wear clothes that stifle individuality? Wearing a uniform isn’t going to make me change your bins any faster (although ngl it is handy to have pockets I can put spare bin liners in, but I could easily find my own trousers to do that with)

I picked up this part time assistant manager position to make some extra cash on the side while I finish school. I am in a few weddings across the country where I’m originally from, within the same 2 weeks. So I requested 2 weeks off so I would be able to attend all of them. When I did so, my boss proceeded to berate me and tell me that i have to realign my priorities because this job clearly wasn’t one of them. She said that everyone else is allowed to take time off because they have been there longer than me. And I won’t be able to take off for an entire year. However, there is no place for me to put availability, so i am expected to be available 7 days a week, and only schedule my life out 2 weeks in advance for an entire year.

My boss also never tells me when I am breaking policy. she instead waits for me to break it for weeks before finally informing me when our district manager is around. I let her know from the beginning that I work other jobs and that I am in school. But when I requested the 2 weeks off, she accused me of lying and said that i said that I would be able to work whenever. Which is not true. On my application it even states that I have other jobs. Am I being insane or is this unreasonable? I am working close to 40 hours a week and this was supposed to be a part time job. 

She also told me that I would only have to do books 1 time a week because there would be another assist on with me. I am currently doing them 3 times a weeks which means getting up at 3:30 and working from 5-2pm. 

Again, this is part time. And instead of showing me how to do things, she instead has me figure them out myself and gets mad when i do them wrong. I guess what I really need to know is, would it be horrible of me to put my notice in without giving  2 weeks and just emailing it in and not showing up ever again? Because I feel like I am being bullied to work full time when I did not sign up for that.

That being said I took on a job this past January promising me one half of my signing bonus after three months of full time employment and then at six months. 
The first chunk I received after the three month check in with the recruiter where I basically had to keep reminding her to “ask and see” when I would receive it. 
This month was my 7 month and now crickets from the recruiter. I have reached out multiple times to anyone in my company that I could asking about the second half and when it would be paid out. No response. Finally I spoke with someone at payroll and suddenly  questions are coming down like “well have you had a full case load this whole time”?  
This is bullsh!t. In fact this has happened every single time I have been offered one of these pitiful bonuses. I don’t want to believe that they are secretly sitting back hoping employees wouldn’t notice but after at least 15 years of this nonsense it’s hard to imagine otherwise. It’s certainly frustrating and even embarrassing at times to feel like I have to beg for something that was stated in my contract. Anyone else? "

He also keeps suspending me without proof of incidences to mess with my salary and have control over me. I am sick and tired of this man.

I am ASC and therefore a protected characteristic.

LM denied telling me I was being hostile earlier this month, instead throwing another manager under the bus for that; instead rolling it back by saying ""I was abrupt"" with her, which was a barefaced lie. Continually tells me she is there to help, when she has been complicit in toxic behaviour, and my mental health has been a rollercoaster for months because of her and the other managers.

When asked if I was being harassed or bullied in work, I told her ""I can't tell"". She was 'worried' about what I had told her, and that I didn't know the distinction. In truth, I'm not about to go nuclear in my job by telling her and HR that four staff members (her included) are collectively bullying and harassing me.

The kicker? She said that if someone was bullying me, she would be there in a flash to report and ensure it was properly dealt with. So, if Big Boss was the one bullying me, she would report her own boss? Not likely.

So, any thoughts on how to deal with four managers that seem to have it in for me?"

But it this category was listed on the performance review, I got a 2 out of 3 points and I felt it was kinda bullshit. 

We’re a small non profit healthcare related company but not religious or anything related to like church. Yet it was explained to me at the review that full points were given to “people who give back/go beyond the mission”. For instance this one coworker donates blood and got full points. And another volunteers to give high schoolers tours -those tasks you can do on the clock, sure kind things to do but those tasks aren’t in my job description I should be judged for not doing them

First of all I think you should let employees know those categories beforehand so they have a chance to improve, not find out at the review. 

Also I think that category is bullshit cause I already do my job and give you my work ethic you want me to give back? And if I don’t I don’t get the max raise amount?

I do have mental illnessness (anxiety and depression) and that makes it 10x worse but I need some way to cope while I attempt to find another job as I took a 2 week mental health LOA and came back today and just broke down due to customers treating me like dirt right off the bat and already starting my day off not being able to meet my sales quotas. If I don't meet my sales quotas this quarter I will lose my reasonable accommodations also that allow me to work 32 hours a week which greatly helps my mental health as I'm also a full time student approaching my senior semester. I can't not have a job due to my bills and medications but at the same time it kills me to have one. I'm not disabled enough to qualify for disability but I struggle to work through these jobs or even find a new one. 

How can I cope? What am I doing wrong?"

2,2024-07-25,“No discussing tips” question ,u/Pibedollarputlong,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ec2lka/no_discussing_tips_question/,antiwork,"So, I work in a semi popular restaurant in a state that pays us minimum wage plus we keep whatever tips we receive each day. We are taxed a very small amount on our checks for those tips as well. 

Our boss loves to tell us we are not allowed to do discuss tips when we’re in BOH asking how each other did the night before. He does this and always reminds us it’s against company policy. 

I know discussing paid wages is acceptable and against the law to stop your employees from discussing, but since tips are additional pay not from the company, I’m unsure if this is a gray area or not. As I stated, we are paid minimum wage not matter so the tips don’t equal out to minimum or higher. 

Are tips and the pay laws viewed differently? "

My boss had limited technical skills and all he did every day was say yes to whatever his boss asked and then pass the tasks down to us. When we needed his support to coordinate with other departments, he would side with them, leaving us with no support. My boss lied about promotions and raises to the whole team multiple times during the performance review cycle. While other departments received financial recognition, no one on our team did. He promised me a raise if I worked hard on a major project, so I put in long hours and gave it my all. But after the project was completed, instead of receiving the promised raise, I was laid off.

This experience has made me realize that the hiring process is fundamentally flawed. Hiring managers can do extensive reference checks on candidates, but we have no way to conduct a solid reference check on our future managers. Sites like Glassdoor or Blind don’t provide the detailed information we need, and LinkedIn is often just a platform for mutual praise. I had no idea I was going to deal with this kind of manager when I first joined the company.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? How did you handle them? What steps did you take afterward?

Thanks for reading and letting me share."

In 2020 I started managing a retail store for a popular eyewear brand, when I started we had about 11-12 employees, great benefits, and decent work life balance.

Since then they’ve reduced our staff to 6 total, over the course of the years they kept reducing hours/staff saying we weren’t making enough money to warrant more, since then we’ve consistently went above and beyond our goals, but never received any more hours/staff and now I’m working much harder, as are the other remaining 5 employees.

In the last 4-6 months they’ve added about 12 dif new functions to my job, new eye pre-tests to perform, new product offerings, multiple spreadsheets to track, cold calling patients who haven’t had exams in a while, teaching patients how to insert contacts, etc.

Now they’ve added yet another and I refused to do it until I see a pay increase and my boss isn’t happy and is going to talk to her boss about it.

That being said, I fulfill everything in my job description.

How do yall handle more work for no additional pay? Does anyone have any tips / tricks for navigating this convo?

Truly at my wits end, burned out, been with the company for 5 years, and I need to find something new/different, so I was also wondering if anyone has any advice on transitioning from retail management to a desk job? "

I know i’m not gonna be able to get back to school after a year without it so i guess i’m gonna have to work. I already know that it will be hell every day but without experience and without a degree i will have a horrible job. 
You’re gonna tell me « if you stay at home you’re not gonna find anything, you have to go out » but even thinking about going out makes me feel bad. I found what i want : doing nothing.
So that’s my situation right now, if you have any advice for me, i’ll appreciate it ! THANKS"

For my job we need a canister of nitrogen. The delivery truck isn’t able to arrive until after we would need it. My boss asked me to pick it up in my personal vehicle. I told him I don’t feel comfortable doing that. He then told me to take his car. He wants me to secure this 4 foot tank of nitrogen in the back of his car and seatbelt it in the backseat. I told him I don’t really feel comfortable doing that and he threw a fit and called me a baby and told me I worry too much. 

Is this safe?

Is this legal? I am in Pennsylvania. 

I currently don’t have health insurance and I’d be driving someone else’s vehicle so I don’t think I’d be covered under his policy. All of this feels like red flags to me. I will be deleting this afterwords, I just need some advice if I should put my foot down and tell him no, or if I should just do it. PA is an at will state and I cannot afford to get fired.

He did.,u/Briyanaism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ec5bwt/my_department_head_publicly_called_me_out_for/,antiwork,"As the title says. I actually really like my job. I also like my company. For the most part, I have fantastic bosses. A couple of weeks back, my Department Head publicly called me out on a damn near company wide emailed. He cc'd everyone important and said I did my job wrong. Implying that my subpar quality of work that will cause us to lose and important client. 

Here's the thing, I didn't! I did my job exactly right and he was calling me out for not following a policy that wasn't even changed until 2 weeks AFTER I completed the job. If he did more than a cursory look into it, he would have saw I went over everything with the customer and they signed off on it!

My immediate supervisors had my back and spoke with him privately. They messaged me within the hour saying they were handling it. Apparently, the situation has been dealt with. My immediate supervisors apologized for it and said I didn't do anything wrong. 

I'm still mad. I take pride in my work. I always put my best foot forward. I believe I have a great work ethic. If there's one insult that never fails to get under my skin, it's being called incompetent at my job. Especially when I know I do quality work. My work has been praised multiple times by customers and those within my company. I've been told it is often used as an example as the standard of what should be done for my Team. 

The last thing all those VPs saw and/or their impression of me, is that I am incompetent at my job. It bothered me so much that I finally shot my Department Head an email, asking him to address in the email chain where he called me out, that I did not do my job wrong. 

Silence. It's been a couple of weeks and he hasn't apologized. Not that I would accept a private apology. If you shame me publicly, you must apologize publicly. 

I know my quality of work speaks for itself. I know my supervisors have my back. I know I did nothing wrong. But man, I am bitter. 

Fully willing to shame me publicly under the impression that I did my job wrong. Now that it's clear that he was the one who did his job wrong, he wants to bury it. "

1307,2024-07-25,Just walked out of interview,u/in0_mY-Cal_Kew_luss,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ec8vyf/just_walked_out_of_interview/,antiwork,"Currently having a beer at the nearest bar as I type this. I just walked out of an interview for the first time. I’m 37F and have spent a lot of time as an independent contractor so I have been through my fair share of interviews. 

About 2 weeks ago I received a text from a rep for a marketing company saying they received my resume and would like to schedule an interview. Two red flags came up: 1) that I was receiving a text instead of email which felt really scammy 2) I never sent them my info. I looked up the company and does look like they seem legit or at least have an office. 
 
This rep was being very persistent in reaching out and I haven’t lined up any interviews lately so I figure what the hell. I ask the rep for more clarity on the role and for a job description document. I’m met with a very vague (text) answer about seeing if it’s a mutual fit. Again, no other interviews lined up so I figure what the hell. 

Their office is a 1 hour drive from me, but I still figure I should see if this is an opportunity. 

When I walked into the office it was a total ghost town. Someone greets me and immediately asks if I brought my resume. People. No one has printers anymore. I don’t even know what version of my resume I sent you. This is a professional office right? Surely the woman who texted me relentlessly gave you my resume? Nope. She is a recruiter that doesn’t even work in their office. Even tho her email signature says she is HR for the company. I have been to many interviews lately and sure it’s never a bad idea to have your resume on hand, but my last few interviews they simply printed it themselves so they could actually read and review it. It became abundantly clear that they had not even looked at my resume. 

I’m an event coordinator professionally. So after giving me the whole speel about how everyone starts on entry level and works up to management level through “training and performance” he then drops the bomb that I would be getting paid by commission. I’m sure he felt my mood switch. He then suggests that I go check out one of the events they currently a “manager” set up at.  

Ya’ll. It was a couple of girls under a tiny umbrella in a hot ass asphalt parking lot basically heckling people as they came out of a little bar on a rough side of town. The “manager” I was supposed to meet with immediately goes into power flex mode and does my absolute pet peeve: when people talk to adults like children. For instance, she said “We follow an acronym called SEE that represents all the things ‘we do and don’t say’. What do you think the S stands for???” And this went on for every letter and then she starts *another* acronym and this continues. FFS

I finally hit my shit roof and I stopped her and said “I can’t do this. i don’t think this is for me.” She basically looked at me with total shock and stuttered over a combination of what/why. So then I asked her why is she talking me like a kid at summercamp, and told her to talk to me like a person. She proceeds to say this is their procedure and that “we are getting there”. As I am explaining I’m interviewing them too and I’d like to ask some questions before proceeding because I have no idea if I want to do this. Again she says “we’re getting there” and I basically said “nah we’re not cause I’m leaving.” She says okay and of course pulls a petty “Good luck on your job search!” As I was walking away the anger hit me for how unprofessional the whole situation was and how they wasted so much of my time. So as I walked to my car I called them fucking crazy and unprofessional time-wasters. Probably could have left off the first part but I was heated in that moment.

Feeling pretty good only wish I left sooner. I don’t have anyone else to vent to so I came to Reddit. Thanks for reading if you made it this far in the post!"

At the end, the lady asked if I included my references in my application and I said no, but that I could email it to her. She copies and pastes her email address on the zoom chat. I thought I had copied it and then closed out the zoom window after we had finished talking. When I pasted her email address, of course it turns out I never copied her email address. I end up verifying her email from the administrative assistant and she said that I had the right email address and even said “you are such a great candidate!” I was already excited since they had asked for my references and now the administrative assistant gave me positive affirmation. A week goes by, I hear nothing back (they said they’d get back in a week or so). I email the assistant for an update last Thursday, nothing. I emailed the lady that had interviewed me 3 days ago, and still nothing. I’m so confused?! Did I just get ghosted? "

2,2024-07-25,Bad situation with manager,u/mijitt000,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ecb5py/bad_situation_with_manager/,antiwork,"I just started a new job a few months ago. It didn't take me long to realize my manager was quite passive aggressive. 

Keep in mind, this whole time from my first day to today, all I've ever done is show her respect and I act like I don't notice the passive aggressiveness. 

There have been several times now where I get very unclear instructions, and then she gets pissed when I don't do the work exactly how she imagined it. When I say ""unclear"", I mean she tells me to do something and I do it, and then when I give it to her there's all of a sudden a bunch of other things she wanted to do as well that I ""didn't do"". 

There are also things that I get blamed for that aren't my fault at all. For example, we had a issue with a client that I offered to solve and she told me she'd solve it. Next thing I know, a week later it's not solved and she's angry at me.

There was a time recently where she told me something I gave her was ""horrible"" because it didn't include all these things that she never told me to include. 

That was the turning point for me where I'm thinking I want to apply elsewhere because 1) I want to be in a positive work environment and 2) she clearly has a problem with me for some reason, so I don't know how secure my position is.

Should I just not include this job and show a 3-4 month break on my resume? How I do explain it? If it helps, I moved to a new place to take this job (maybe that can help explain?). I'm not mad, I like where I live. I just really don't like where I work."

It’s just devastating because I was very excited, the hours worked well with me and the owners are friends with my grandparents and were my former teachers in middle school. 

Since I have cashiering experience, I was just told to be on the till for the first week and then I would eventually learn the food and drink recipes. I didn’t have any barista experience but I figured that everything would be okay and that I’ll eventually learn. At first, everything seemed to be going okay. One of the owners/my boss did state that she didn’t want to get employees at first because she liked things in a particular way. I just thought, “Oh. I’ll just have to be extra careful with organization.” However, near the end of the shift during the cafe’s closing time, I was told to hurry up with rinsing the smoothie blenders. There were some teeny tiny soap bubbles on the blades, which I got yelled at for. I took responsibility but thought that was an overreaction. I thought maybe my boss was just stressed out so I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.

On my second day, I was told to put away some cream cheese in small cups for bagels. The only thing that my boss told me was to just make sure that the cream cheese portions were equal. I managed to get yelled at again because I was magically supposed to know that I was supposed to use the entire container of cream cheese for twelve of those cups when she didn’t even mention it. I also felt my heart sink when I overheard whisper to my coworker that she was so excited to hire me, only to be disappointed because I’m slow-paced. I didn’t want to disappoint my family members, so I tried to pretend that everything was good.

Today, which was my third and final day. The other owner was here and at first, everything seemed to be going okay. The other owner did eventually get after me a little bit because I washed the blender for too long during a “busy period” even though no customers were rang up during that time. I did communicate the best I could with orders. Since the other owner had a meeting, I had to rush a little bit during closing. I thought everything would be better and that I’ll eventually have a more positive experience. Except, I got a text at around 3 pm saying that I was fired because I wasn’t fit for the job, was too introverted and kept to myself, and wasn’t well at multi-tasking.

I feel embarrassed because I genuinely tried my hardest and I know my family will hear about me getting fired but honestly, I know they’ll understand my side of the story. Plus, the other employees are still in high school and I know they’ll probably be struggling and eventually go bankrupt if they expect their employees to magically know everything in a day. I got another, much better, domestic violence advocate job anyways.

It seems pointless to appeal it and I can’t quit this job with nothing lined up. It’s complicated by the fact that I’m a contractor and not employed directly by the university. 

This job is aging me so bad, in the span of just over a year I feel like my skin looks like shit and I have more gray hair. I’m almost back to the physical shape I was in two summers ago but not quite up to my own standards, and even just for mental health’s sake, the amount of physical activity I need to offset being at a desk most of the day- even a standing desk, since I’m still inside in this shitty office with no windows and bad lighting/ventilation- takes up most of the rest of my day during the week. 

Has anyone else been in the same situation? 

As far as finding a new job, I’m also looking to get out of IT (helpdesk). I signed up for a product management course through CareerFoundry and they guarantee job placement within six months of finishing the course. I’m also taking the Google UX design certificate. But now I’m regretting it because I’m already going crazy being in front of a computer all day, so I don’t know how I’ll get through it and I’m panicking. 

If I had the money to not work, I’d just quit my job and power through the PM course, but I’m not in that position. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m so sad because summer is my favorite time of year. I live in Chicago…so most of the year, the weather sucks. And I just feel like I’m wasting my life at this job, stuck inside. It’s really starting to make me depressed and angry. And I don’t want to feel that way during a time of year when usually, I finally feel good (I have seasonal affective disorder). "

We filed complaint after complaint about him, (including him smoking weed on the job. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about weed, but I view it the same as drinking on the job.) At one point, we were told to get over it and act as adults as it was just a personality clash. Like, no, this dude is quite literally being aggressive and being a problem. Nothing ever happened. Our complaints fell on deaf ears.

Anyways. We got into an argument, I said screw it, not worth my time. Than he starts hurling insults at me. I snap at him, he than clears 10 feet of a distance and gets right up in my face. So, I push him with one hand to get him away from me. He than literally thanked me and touted happily how he was going to get me fired and PRANCED away.

So yeah. I get put on suspension for a week and a half for ""investigation."" I had one call with HR to give my side of the story. I had a witness as well, and had mentioned another coworker saw his attitude before and was a character witness. They fired the both of us. I was told I violated the anti-discrimination and harassment policy. When I asked for an explanation, the HR lady said ""I'm not getting into it with you."" And than when I said I deserve to have an explanation she goes ""I don't have to explain anything to you.""

So the take-away that my coworkers now have is that the company doesn't care about your safety, but will punish you when you take measures to protect yourself. I was amazed that we were both fired honestly. Like, how the hell do you manage to admit that the dude was in the wrong, but than also tell me I can't get someone out of my personal space?"

So I get to the bank for orientation. They take a handful of us down an elevator into this dark, cold, cement room to fill out paper work. The computers in the room are ancient and they keep emphasizing how we're not alloeed to wear jeans... For an over the phone position. 

They hand out peanut butter bars as snacks which I and a few others cant eat. Thankfully im just intolerant cause some people explode at a whiff of peanuts. 

And as Im writing out my social on the tax forms, something just snaps in me. I tell them I dont want to be here and I walk out. 

Then I walk back in cause I cant figure out hoe to leave. 

Then I walk out again. 

I got black listed by the contracting agency for a few months but it was definitely the right call. "

Part of the policy is that any leaves exceeding 5 days need to be requested 1 month prior, which is what I did.

Yesterday, I was put on a PIP due to my mental health affecting my performance. As I need the money to take care of my parents, I reluctantly accepted it.

Part of the benefits we have is 4 company-sanctioned days off of our choosing. I will be travelling on August 29, so I naturally set my schedule up to have 29 and 30 off from those days.

Today, my team leader informs me that since I'm on PIP, all those leaves are cancelled. Also, they informed me that I am not allowed to take more than 10 consecutive days off, and my travel puts that on 11.

I've been planning to take a hiatus off work to work on my mental health and weight. Besides, I've already made all my travel arrangements already, and I'm 100% firm on those commitments, considering 2 days of this trip will be dead anyway (departure and arrival).

It's an employer's market here, so I'm heavily considering quitting. An alternative is to tell them not to pay me on those two days, but their move has left such a bad taste in my mouth."

I was trying to get worker’s comp and accommodations for the job, but my doctor’s recommendations are incompatible with the essential functions of the job. 
The company has offered me two options: I either take a retail position within the company for almost $3/hour less than I make now, or I resign. 
I cannot afford this pay cut. Not only is it incredibly demeaning given the experience I have in the industry and my time at the company, it is not enough to cover my bills. 
However, I have nothing else lined up and cannot go without a job. 
If I resign, I won’t qualify for unemployment. 
Additionally, the pain in my knees is debilitating. If I resign, I also can’t get short term disability from my job. I feel incredibly stuck.

Ive been chatting to mates who are customer facing and some of the stuff they tell me that kicks off over literally bugger all is incredible. 

Our neigbours daughter has just turned 17 and  pre GCSE she was working as a waitress at a local cafe. Employers were lovely. No unreasonable demands, decent pay and she could take any hours she wanted to suit school life. 

She recently left though as customers were just so nasty to her over nothing it was casuing undue stress pre exams. 

Just one of the examples she gave was shen she took orders to a table of 6 and asked who had what the lead of the table got proper arsey and said ""you should know you took the orders"" and the stared her down.

She said in general peope were just short and rude for no reason too. Like they wouldnt make a public scene like your classic karen they just held everyone else up for nothing.

Another friend of mine works as a receptionist and this week at bang on closing time a woman ran up to the door and started banging on the glass thats its an emergency and she needs something quick (she needed a blood test request form). Her and her colleauge opened the door and she proceeded to stand about 3m from the desk and whisper her details. 

My friend asked her to speak up or come closer which she did neither of then accused my friend of making fun of her, for her greek last name. My friend re itterated that was not the case and she just didnt hear her but this woman could not be convinced until the woman started shouting...

My friend got to work this morning to get an email forwarded from HR with a completely differnt story 3 lines in and hows its all my friends fault and this woman has to know the outcome of this situation and demands an apology for her actions...

All this then remined me of the time when i worked at a dealership and had an old chap raise a few quieries and questions about his new car. I spent an hour with him explaining all the bits he wanted to know (sales' job. Not mine) and I even took a piece off of one of our showroom cars to fix an issue he claimed to have. After all this he contacted management and said a tech came out to him but seemee disinterested and was no help to him at all. 

Its always the older geeration too i need to note. I have had ONE shitty encounter with my generation and while it was big a single encounter doesnt compare to a load of bullshit over nothing.

     Some context, my girlfriend works at a restaurant as a server and has a side gig as a baby sitter for a family. She’s ALWAYS working for them Wednesdays so it’s never been in her availability for months. These assholes scheduled her on a Wednesday and while the owner is on vacation fired her without warning or notice when she didn’t show up. She only knew she was scheduled that day because she checked the schedule for the next day and saw she was supposed to work. Nobody called her to ask where she was or to tell her she missed a shift, and now she’s just deleted from the schedule. Bitch ass manager doesn’t like my girlfriend because she’s repeatedly brought up tip share. the waiters tip out 4%(!!!) of sales to bussers, equaling to 20% of tips, even on days where they don’t have bussers. When she brought this up they swore up and down the bussers got all that money on the weekend but when she worked as busser she didn’t receive near as much money as they’re putting in to tipshare. She averages like $200 as a server so she’s tipping out $40 every shift when they only have bussers on Saturday and Sunday. So multiple servers are tipping out $40 in a day but when she worked a shift as a busser on a Saturday she made $70 off tip share. Obviously the math makes no sense at all, they can’t explain it at all and get flustered and mad when it comes up. It really seems like retaliation for one thing, and even though it’s Texas I have a feeling it’s not exactly legal to fire someone for not showing on a day that had been agreed upon as not available since the beginning of her working there. How do we respond to these work place shmucks?"
0,2024-07-26,"I don't understand the complaint that CEOs/owners ""don't do any actual work"", can someone explain this to me?",u/TooLateRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ecom4h/i_dont_understand_the_complaint_that_ceosowners/,antiwork,"Hello! I like to read this sub because I like to understand the opinions of people I disagree with, because I feel that if you're going to be against a certain idea you have to actually understand that idea. So I feel that after some time I have a decently good understanding of most of the opinions people have here, and even though I might disagree with many of them I understand where they are coming from and the logic behind them.

With this particular talking point however I am a bit lost, and I would appreciate if you guys could break this down for me as it does not really fit with my experience. For context I work in a medium-sized family run business and the owner really has nothing to do most days, and complains a lot that he's bored at work. But when his father was in charge he had a lot of work, and would regularly be at the office from 7am-6pm busy the whole time.

When he took over however, he realized that a lot of the work he was doing wasn't something that really needed to be done by him (his father was something of a control freak and didn't trust employees to do a good job without his direct oversight), and so he hired a bunch more staff and began delegating the work to them. And so gradually he had less and less work to do, to the point that now most of the time he's sitting around doing nothing while the company mostly runs itself.

But I don't see how that's really an issue? He could do more work, but that would mean fewer jobs at the company and more work/stress for him. By delegating he created additional jobs for others, and less stress for himself. He's essentially paying to not have to work. This seems like a good thing? 

I dunno, maybe I'm missing something here. To me it seems like if an owner or CEO is busy working all day it's probably because he hasn't organized things at his company properly, he should just be there to make major decisions or to deal with problems as they crop up, which shouldn't really happen all that often.

I anticipate that the answer is gonna be something along the lines of ""well if he's not doing anything why should he get such a large share of the profit?"", but it doesn't seem reasonable to me that someone who's able to set up a company to run itself should be punished for being good at what he's doing. If I'm a factory worker and I found a way to do my job more easily should I get a pay cut because I'm not working as hard anymore? 

So yea, my main question is why are we focused on how much work a CEO/owner might be doing rather than how well they're doing their job? If they can do everything they need to do working 5 hours a week that's better than someone who would do the same job working 8 hours a day.

Thanks in advance for any answers."

I have been working technical for 7 years. By technical, I mean, I do generate tangible outcome at the end of the day. I work in IT. Recently, I started to get involved in the meetings with big software vendors. These people have various roles such as sales, account mamanger, customer success manager etc. The point is, they seem to arrange a meeting with us to repeat things which are available on the website of said software vendor. They just literally repeat what's available on the website. What is the point of these roles? Why do they get paid? I understand, most customers have specific questions / requirements and sometimes It's good to talk to a SME about that question / requirement but overall they just seem to talk about things I can also find by myself.

I also do work with project managers and business analysts internally. Most of them are not technical enough to follow what's being discussed. Thefore they ask us (technical team) what was discussed. They get our answers, put them in an email and send It to the management as ""status updates"". Seriously, If I provide the information they need, why are they even employed? I am not saying that all project managers / business analysts are like this but I hope, you got the main point.

Why are there so many middle man jobs?  We talk about AI but we just don't even consider to eliminate at least half of the middle man jobs. Why do I have to meet with a ""Customer Success Manager"" to get informed about a new feature? It's all available on the internet already. (Remind you that, they don't provide any technical insight) 

I gave examples from IT but I am sure there are similar jobs in all industries. As society, we undervalue people who actually do work and we overvalue these types of white collar jobs. I don't understand this."

Graduated high school with an associates. Went and got my undergrad at 21 then decided it was too early to go into the work force so i got a master's at 22 now have been working a corporate job since then for the past year. 

First of all, I hate how little free time i have compared to college. I'm an athlete at heart. In college, i juggled 6 classes with a 3.2 GPA, bodybuilding full time 6 days a week, competing in jiu jitsu 7 days a week, and then taking off from time to time on sundays to go ski for 8 hours. My average day was 5 hours of working out and staying active and now don't have time for all the hobbies I want to enjoy nor the money. Unlike college where if you finish work early and you're rewarded; You're stuck for 8 hours a day at a corporate job regardless. 

Side note but i make decent money but it all goes away fast. INSIDIOUS rents, crazy groceries, plus a 360 mo car payment when my old truck finally shit the bed at 200 thousand miles. If i want to travel in a particular month, that blows out any money saving i had budgeted for that month and that's doing almost everything i can to travel cheaply. 

The job i got is in a downtown metro area that is way too expensive to live in and i commute over an hour to work 3 days a week in office.

Not to add insult to injury but i can EASILY work this job remote but the company refuses to set up a remote check processing system that would be needed to fully go remote; A relatively small task in the grand scheme of things. 

I promised myself i would only work this job 6 months and pack up to move to my home state which is significantly cheaper. Well that never happened. So many declined emails, interviews that went nowhere, and straight up bait and switch jobs where it really wasn't what was promised. The title and responsibilities were stated a certain way so they could try to chronically underpay you. 

Now a year plus at this company, my coworker quit. Using some ADHD genes (and wicked stimulants), i took up over 50% of the slack they left behind and did the job flawlessly for the next month without working so much as an extra hour more of 40 hours. 

In the meantime, i was trying to get a friend hired who was a rockstar in group work during my master's who has been unemployed since he graduated. 

Welp, management SANDBAGGED the job and put someone with over 10 years of experience in an entry level role then gave her a mid level job title. They said my guy interviewed great but they ""felt better about the other person"". 

Seeing as this new worker took basically what is my same job and got a better job title out of it, I went to management seeking a promotion for my quality of work and carrying extra responsibility the past month.

They told me that i didn't have enough seniority and to wait another 6 months...yea bullshit. I don't care if new coworker has 10 years of experience. They have NO seniority with us as a conpany. 

So here i am fuming, hating this rather monotonous job i do, wishing i could do other things, struggling to feel financially comfortable, and wondering where the hell it all went wrong. I hate my existence 5 of the 7 days every week passes and I feel my sanity slip away every month. 

This whole corporate mess has me wanting to try to get popular in the bodybuilding social media world which can be lucrative and just hoping my employer doesn't catch on to my content before i start getting affiliate brand deals to make some kind of money doing this.

I was 8 minutes late this morning, as my first time ever being late at this job. My supervisor said someone was asking where I was. It may have been no one important and it may have just been someone genuinely asking because they needed me, but she made it seem like a big deal. I come in at 7:45 everyday. My hours are technically 8-5, but I’m here 7:45-5 almost everyday. 8:08 today and “people were asking questions”.

We work on a 9/80 schedule. Over the course of 9 work days, we do 80 hours and the 10th day we have off. So every other Friday, the building is closed. Pretty sweet schedule, in my opinion. I was always given the impression that as long as we make our hours each week add up to 40, they don’t care how we do it. They do NOT pay overtime.

I’ve made it clear to my supervisor that I will not be doing any extra time outside of the hours that are required. I get the impression she doesn’t like that I’ve set that boundary. She’s the type of person who takes work home on the weekends and puts in lots of overtime to get ahead of things. I get it I guess? She has said she loves this job. I can tell she’s the “live to work” type, but I work to live. Outside of 8-5 on work days, my time belongs to me. So you can imagine me biting my tongue when she suggested that I give an extra 30 mins or hour a few days a week to show those who are “asking questions” that I’m putting in the work. Um… No. I won’t be doing that. Seems just a tad extreme over being 8 minutes late one time when I already do put in the work.

It has soured my mood for the day and I feel a little paranoid of my coworkers. I now know I’m being watched at work if someone came to my supervisor to make a comment. Thankfully, my time here is temporary. In the beginning, I did feel bad that I might be screwing people over down the line. I accepted the job offer knowing I wouldn’t even be there a full year. Basically, I was hired to help with my supervisor’s workload. She had been doing it on her own for years before they finally promoted her and allowed her to hire someone to fill the position under her (her old position). Her workload is still heavy even with me taking over a lot, but I can only do the things she’s trained me to do so far. My workload doesn’t need overtime to be completed while hers still does. Maybe she feels some type of way about it? Maybe she’s using that person’s comment as a way to express that she wants me to work like she does? Based on her personality, this woman would take work home and work overtime even if she didn’t need to, so I had been taking her other comments about me working outside of normal hours with a grain of salt. She’s been working that way for so long I think she’s forgotten that that’s HER normal. Not how it should be. Regardless… After something like this, and if this kind of thing continues, I won’t feel any guilt when it’s time to submit my resignation."

I've never told anyone about it but damn I'm sitting here, unemployed, trying to apply to jobs but then my mind goes into panic mode due to all the trauma I've experienced while working for shit on a spoon in the past 5 years of my life. Im scared of people because they're more unpredictable than a bat in a cave. Or I get rubbed up on if they have the chance, it happened so much. Just keep ur croches off of me. Idk I want to just bathe in hand sanitizer to get it all off me. I've been sexually assaulted so much as a child and *now this*. It never ends and idk how it'll stop unless if I just quit going out.

By being afraid of being accused of sexual harassment, they are downplaying the cases that have been reported. If they think that a casual slip up of a flirty comment or compliment is the what triggers most women to report someone for sexual harassment, they are deeply disrespecting a women's (or any victim's) judgement and experience. 

I understand that we can't control our fears so I don't want to shame anyone for anything. I just think it's something that needs to be worked out with a mental health professional because it's inappropriate to let fears like that dictate the way we treat people.

I don't understand how someone made her a manager, she has no sense of management whatsoever. She enthusiastically calls the whole team to office even when there is no rule, and cancels on us at the last moment. She talks in a very unprofessional manner to my teammates and me in calls and in person.

She keeps micro managing us when it's not required. One day she called the whole team and nobody showed up due to rain except me and she also didn't show up(if you are calling people to office you should have the courtesy to at least communicate before cancelling), when I called her she kept saying that she'll reach in 30 min and never showed up. All of us live very far from the office and she lives at 2km distance and doesn't understand our pain. She's a bootlicker for sure trying to get brownie points for making her team come to office even when it's not required. 

Whenever there is an issue she never takes her teams side and always throws us under the bus and shows how good a manager she is by putting pressure even when it's not required. She pings us 3 times a day to close a PR and never replies herself when it comes to our requirements. She never communicates us before on which calls are compulsory to join. Our team is new so we need to understand the system so if we join a call she says it's not required for you and if we don't she very unprofessionally asks ""tune join kyu nai ki call? Watt lagwani hai kya apni"" which i feel is rude.

I still don't understand how to handle these kind of situations. Do you guys face the same thing? Am i overreacting? My previous manager was so professional and for that reason even if i like my work i hate my work here. 

Forgot to mention in all the office parties she keeps on pushing people to drink even when they don't. She says ""tera review bigad dungi"" if you don't drink. One of my friends didn't drink at all and she almost cried after the party was over. She tried saying no but the constant bullying made her uncomfortable like hell."

My job title is “independent labor for hire.” Sometimes depending on the job I’m doing I might work with another more experienced person, like when I do landscaping or gardening I’ll get paid by a boss but other times I get paid in cash directly, like if I’m mowing lawns or shoveling driveways. I do all my labor under the table. I still live in my parents house and I do all their grocery shopping and cleaning to be nice. I graduated college in 2023 with a decent GPA and an irrelevant degree. I’ve applied to white collar jobs but have had no luck. They expect so much experience but what kind of experience would someone my age even have? I had a solid internship junior year which I thought would give me a leg up. My parents encourage me to keep applying and they’re supportive of me doing odd jobs, but friends of mine from college think it’s “not a real job” or they ask “what are you planning to do?” I think I’m realizing I’m not cut out for corporate or office jobs. I have ADHD and school isn’t  that enjoyable, I have a very hard time with reading comprehension and focusing. I don’t wanna spend decades doing pointless meetings and documents. I wanna work with my hands. I feel satisfied like I accomplished something. I don’t feel satisfied looking at spreadsheets and stuff.

Before signing this contract, it was a decent job. Good pay, stability, PTO, can take vacation whenever, long lunch break, etc. 

Recently they started changing most of the benefits. They started off by making it so that you couldn’t take time off for a vacation, it had to be deemed a good reason. That already made me furious because I’m in a long distance relationship and try to see my partner at least quarterly. It got to the point where I have to start lying about what I’m doing on my time off and say it’s for medical reason or something similar. It didn’t matter if you had PTO to use or coverage, if they didn’t want to approve it they won’t. I know some of you are thinking that I don’t owe them a reason why I’m taking time off, but to them if it’s not urgent enough they won’t approve it. 

Then, they took away our PTO and sick time and I’m not sure why. Great. So now if I want to take a vacation or if I get sick or injured I’m fucked. I feel trapped right now. The only way for me to complete my contract is to pay off the debt over the course of 2 years or pay it all at once then leave. But I don’t have that money right now.

There is one common factor I seem to notice exclusively with corporate jobs and specifically jobs where there are a lot of coworker interactions. 

Is it completely normal for people to flat out ignore you. Not that I am demanding for attention of some sort, but I notice a trend where people simply choose not to acknowledge you on their own accords and actively  not do it to everyone else and I find that to be incredibly rude. 

I am a pretty quiet, but so are 2-3 other people as well who are equally as quiet, but why is it that they go as far as to actively not respond specifically to what I say when I don’t do anything, but my job. I am not unfriendly either. 

When I bring up certain things in discussions, they will entertain, get happy, praise the idea, and even build an entire conversation on the point, and then they immediately actively credit it to someone else. 

It feels like they don’t even acknowledge me as a person. I always respond to everyone that talks to me.

Here’s an overly simplified example of what I mean:

Person A: I wonder is there is a way to do x, y, z.

Me: Brings up an Idea and everyone immediately entertains it.

Person B: Says nothing.

Person A: Wow! Person B that is a wonderful idea! You’re so great at x, y, z. Continues to credit them the entire rest of work. 

*Person A then forgets only  my name.*

I feel this is very rude. Am I over reacting or is this not some mild form of relational bullying? 

They also do this thing where they will only not respond to and answer my questions. I don’t excessively talk either or bring any of my personal opinions into the workplace. Is there some sort of social hierarchy?"

I devoted 3 years of my life there. Worked off the clock, bought things with my own money, went extremely out of my way to do extra tasks, and followed all the rules. The only thing I don't regret is doing everything I could to make 40 hours of my employee's week better.

Looking back at it, I was a work junkie. It was a high for me. The money didn't matter. All I wanted to do was be at work. On my days off I would sleep just to make the time go by faster so I could be back at work sooner. When I wasn't sleeping, I'd be doing work tasks on my phone. When I was at work I'd never take my breaks or even take the time to eat or drink. I never felt burned out though. Work was my speed and excelling at it kept me going.

My narcissistic boss didn't like how I challenged him by for sticking up for myself after he said something out of pocket in a group text. Next day, I received my termination letter. Now I have nothing. I don't know who I am. I have no purpose. I've done nothing but cry for the past week. Can barely open my eyes because they're swollen. Haven't left my bed or showered. Never felt this depressed in my life.

Just posting this to advise others to not be like me. If you have to work, just work. Get that paycheck and nothing more. The people you work for do not care about you. You are just a name in a time clock and a way for them to make money.

Got a phone interview. Went great. Guy seemed nice. The next week he emails me asking if I can do an in-person interview the very next day at 11:15am. This is a time when I am typically working 1 of my 2 other jobs. So I told him I cannot and provided him with 2 days with multiple times I was available the next week (he wanted me in on a Friday). 

Never heard back from the guy again. Today, 3 weeks later, I got an email from their HR system thanking me for my application and letting me know they did not select me. No fucking shit lol.

So I emailed the guy I interviewed with and here's what I wrote:

>Am I to understand that because I had a prior commitment and was unavailable for an interview where you only gave me one date/time option with only one days notice that you deemed me unfit for this position? Just because of that? Typically, employers provide multiple date/time options for an in-person interview. I find this all highly unprofessional. If this is how you treat your employees, with no respect for their personal time/lives, then I am glad I did not get this position. Thank you for the opportunity. 

Felt good to say that to this asshole. Its nice being on the job hunt and just getting to drag asshole employers and call them out on their unprofessionalism with no repercussions as you do not work for them."

My employer does not give us bathroom breaks. I understand the logic of it as I'm sure there are people who would abuse them if we had them. However, myself and other coworkers have been having issues with this relevant to medical diagnoses. 

We have to use our break time to go to the bathroom. I've been coached for going over that time as I have medical conditions that cause me frequent restroom visits. 

I was told that if I need an accommodation, I must get a doctor's note. I do not have access to company medical benefits yet, and upon reviewing the offered plans, I won't be able to afford one when I do get access because of how little I'm paid. With that in mind, I have started working with a clinic for people who are uninsured. I'm sure anyone who has gone through this knows they don't do anything fast.

My operations manager and team lead have been bugging me for this note, and I was just told today that the temporary solution for this problem will no longer be an option (clocking out and in when I need to take time and am going to go over break time).

This is all meanwhile the team lead is never accessible when needed for assistance, because he is outside every hour on the hour having a smoke break.

How is this fair? 

Not to mention, a coworker had her medical accommodation denied upon giving them a doctor's note. What's the point?

I'm open to insight and advice, but I will definitely be looking for another job."

Lately she has been having trouble breathing and they said she has pulmonary embolism in both lungs. Her bones are brittle her doctors don’t even recommend light exercise. I am her full time caregiver.

But I am also the main breadwinner in our family and have to work full time. 

My job is hybrid and I am required to go onsite 2 days a week. It sounded reasonable, my husband works graveyard shift and he takes over watching her when I have to go in.

However, he also needs to sleep and when she is struggling, I cannot just leave her.  If she can’t breathe and no one is available I fear the worst.

My employer is not very sympathetic and I got in trouble for not coming in when I was supposed to, even though I get all my work done.

Today I had to stay home, and I was fully capable of working from home in between checking on her and taking her to the doctors or picking up her meds.

Today they had me use a sick day even though people are still calling, emailing and sending chats. I am salaried and they expect me to work weekends and evenings to get my projects done. I don’t mind figuring if I do this for them, when I need them to be flexible, they will be.

Nope. They suck and I don’t know how this will all play out. All my reviews has been excellent, I am always helpful and complete my projects on time.

I can’t just look for another job, I am 59yo and wanted this to be my last job. 

What would you do in this situation? Wait for them to fire me for calling out too much?"

2,2024-07-26,What should I do next?,u/meghanwho,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eczz65/what_should_i_do_next/,antiwork,"So, I worked at a children's restaurant/entertainment business, I worked there for nine months and put everything I had into it. The way my job worked is that there are three different ""stations"", the cash register, the prize counter and the entrance/exit. While I was working I had to tend to all three by myself, I could usually manage on good days, but I would need some help on not so good days.

One morning, it was extremely busy, there were three other people working in the kitchen, two managers and a new guy, I was the only person handling customers. I think at one point it there were probably about 30 or so people in the cash/prize lines, with many other people just walking out when I needed to check them out. The managers in the back were of no help, I think one of them even left during this time. They had the new guy doing prep work instead of making food, they have had new people make food on their first day, so I'm not sure why they couldn't have him do that while someone helped me with customers.

The manager that was left was less than helpful, I'm not sure what she was doing because the amount of food orders I had did not mean she couldn't help me, especially if she had the new guy making food as well. I was getting very overwhelmed at this point as I was all alone with floods of customers coming in and all of my scheduled breaks are late.

When she finally did send me on my 30 minute lunch when more people clocked in, I cried the entire time. No one said a thing, the manager that I thought was my friend (my mistake) didn't even say hi like she always does. I know this is a stupid thing to get upset about and it's supposed to be a professional environment, but it wasn't ever that way, and when my manager ""friend"" was having difficult times at work I would try my best to make her feel better, but I didn't get any of that back.

After my break I got pretty mad, just being overwhelmed and the lack of help that I could have gotten was building in my head. I should have just walked out at that point or tried to talk it out more because my actions were not acceptable. I started yelling in the back ""room"" (it is a part of the kitchen with nothing but a small door separating it from the cash registers, so the customers could probably hear me) and making a bit of a scene, being overly exaggerated in front of the customers and showing that I was definitely not in a good mental state. It came to a point where I kicked a wall in the back room, I didn't do any damage, but there was a black scuff.

I was finally told to go into the office and asked to go home. The next day I went into work and the store manager was there, she told me to write down my reasons for my actions, I said something to ""my actions were inexcusable and I should have done things differently, but with the lack of help when I was clearly overwhelmed, I let my emotions get away from me"". She had me sign it and I was told I am not allowed on the premises until I get a call, I was told this call would be in about 2-3 days. I called on the 4th day asking about the progress and I was told I would get a call. Almost a month later on the day, I call the store again inquiring about my job, I get told again, I will get a call in a few minutes, I finally get that fucking call half an hour later. I am told they tried to call me a few times but they must have had the wrong number and that I am fired due to my cussing and kicking a wall.

So what should I do now, I know I should have called them back sooner, but it was a very busy month for me due to family visiting. I know they could have called me sooner because they have called before to ask that I not come in due to the store being slow, and multiple managers texting me using the correct phone number. Should I file unemployment? Do I have any legal basis to sue? Would it be worth it to sue even if I can? Should I just move in with my life and forget about this?

TL;DR: I blew up during work on a busy day because I didn't have any help, get told I will get a call in a few days. Call a month later and get told I'm fired."

On the 4th of March, I got injured on the job making a delivery. The emergency room put me in a horrible makeshift cast (I say makeshift because what they put me in was not medical grade) that caused issues later. I figured out after two mri scans that I had fractured my talus bone and partially tore a ligament, stressed 3 other ligaments. For the first 3 months the pain was terrible, couldn't sleep very much, couldn't walk at all or stand in the shower. I started going to this workers comp issues doctor and physical therapy. I have mental health issues as well as adhd so I'm prone to forgetting important things. One day, I got a call from the facility and the receptionist had this demeaning, nasty attitude because I forgot an appointment. First of all, no I didn't, you never sent me the confirmation text to my cell, my email or even a phone call. So I decide to go to a closer location for physical therapy. Fast forward to about early July, things are going OK up til this point. So to try and help give a general timeline, it's currently the 26th of July. 6 weeks ago, this doctor pointed out that I've been out of work for a while and said I needed more Intense physical therapy, however, I was asked to wait so it can be approved. 2 weeks later, the same doctor said that intense pt is no longer necessary. I've been voicing my concerns about my back pain that's been present for the past 4 weeks from this visit. He said ""you should probably go see someone about that."" Got me really upset but I let it go. Keep in mind, I've been asking this asshole for months questions like ""how long do you think I'll be out for?"" ""How long do you think it will take for me to fully heal?"" And ""when will I be able to do things like running, standing for long periods of Tim's, going up stairs, inclines, declines, etc?"" And he never answers them, he either shrugs off the questions or pretends I never asked them. This last visit yesterday, he said that I should go back to work. ""The best kind of therapy is going back to work and continuing like normal."" I looked it up, this sack of shit is partially saying this to save the insurance money. Companies usually want to pay the least amount to injured workers and get em back to work sooner than they should. So on that note, fuck you doctor. Secondly, I don't think he fully understands what I do for my job as a dominos delivery driver (which btw, people keep leaving so idk who my store manager is anymore and the supervisor just won't give them my wages because workers comp keeps owing me money). One thing I'm ashamed to admit is I didn't get any of this in writing, I've inadvertently made this situation harder on myself. The physical therapist I saw at this new location a few months ago said maybe November if not early December. That's the only answer I've gotten. I've written an email to my workers comp case manager saying hey this is what's going on, I want a second opinion. I've also scheduled an appointment with my own primary care doctor to see what she thinks. I hate this doctor with every fiber of my being. I'm scared I'm going to lose benefits from workers comp and won't be able to stay here any longer (my father has been an absolute hero and paying my rent in the apartment for months now, he's a teacher and has a good amount of money so i know I'm not hurting him, he also has zero issue with me and my romantic partner coming back home if necessary, the only thing that's holding us back is her disability process, if we move it starts over, not to mention redoing her medical stuff again). What else can I do except collect every document thus far and making phone calls/setting up appointments? Also I just wanna day again, fuck you doctor"

I've complained about this on other subreddits, but leadership has implemented a ""take calls and chats at the same time"" policy. This policy was made permanent right around the time I was hired.

So we're working tickets in the first place, cuz you gotta squeeze every last bit of productivity from your wage slaves, while we are waiting for the phone to ring or a chat to come in. So let's say I get a chat first. Cool, answer their questions, put the ticket on hold, start a remote session with the chatter's computer, do the job as it was advertised, all good. 

Then another chat comes in. If you're able (and you're supposed to be able) you take the second chat too, and continue working with both customers at the same time. 

Then a third chat comes in. Then a call. Now thankfully, nothing else can come in while you're on a call, but you've still got the three other chats going on, oh yeah and that ticket you were in the middle of, and someone talking in your ear, demanding real time interaction, all at once.

I've (cautiously) complained about this to my manager. She says if you're not able to keep working them all at once, then put the chats on hold while you work with the phone user. Of course, you're supposed to communicate with the chat users that you are putting them on hold, with a polite little message like, ""Just a moment"". Can't just leave them cold. 

I get I overwhelmed if I'm working more than 3 things at a time, so I move myself to unavailable if I'm really busy. Well, I've noticed that I'm the only one putting myself as unavailable. In a team of 20+ people, they all seem still be available, all the time. In fact, earlier today one of the eager new trainees reached out to me to ""let me know"" I'm ""still"" unavailable. (I was working with a crazy lady and it was a hour and a half long call.) 

I guess what pisses me off is that I seem to be the only one struggling???? One of the guys, an older guy, looks like he should be retired, will reject calls on occasion. But he's doing it less and less, and I suspect leadership talked to him. But everyone else just goes along with this. I've (cautiously) complained to several coworkers about this, and I hear, ""You'll get used to it."" One of my coworkers even started giving me tips, like going from one screen, doing an action, then going to the next screen, and doing an action. She talked like it was reasonable. No one else is speaking out. Meanwhile my boss tells me, ""You'll get better with practice,"" subtly setting up the expectation that I need to get over this handicap. 

Am I insane? Is this not absolutely unreasonable? Why am I the only one struggling? What the fuck is going on?"

There's no reason this has to be political. We're at each other's throats over social issues, but we should be in lockstep over economic ones. I'm to the ""right"" according to our stupid political labels, but in any sane time I'd be seen as center left due to my economic views. 

There needs to be a way we can have a ""temporary truce"" on social issues so we can get together against those who are the enemies of all of us. This is so hard because these issues are tremendously emotional, but imagine how much better it would be if we could disagree from positions of comfort and security. The added stress of economics is killing us. It's the icing on the cake that leads to serious social disorder.

Companies KNOW what advantage they can take of hires when they are just an intern of an employee. They are liable for basically nothing from benefits to job security. Laws are pretty strong for labour but everything is a grey area for intern in India. They are rarely a part of EPF (retirement fund) too.

Having said that, I feel intern roles should only be for students who have 0 experience and should never be more than 3 months. They should be served a 2-weeks notice  if they are not going to convert them to full-time employees. Certificates of experience should be mandatory and they must at least have a retirement fund. Internships should be equally seen under labour laws too. What do you guys think?"

I found a company I really enjoyed working for because it was a fun environment & the hours were pretty decent, but today changed that in an instant. So one of my disabilities is that I have Sickle Cell Disease and I had an attack earlier today, so I’m typing this while at the hospital under copious amounts of morphine. I work at an escape game place, so if somebody calls out, the managers have to either call someone in who knows how to run that game, or they just can’t run the game for a few hours that day. I’m the morning shift, which is pretty slow as is, but my attendance has always been stellar so I never worried about how they handle call ins. So today I’m at the gym, went a little too hard & it triggered a sickle cell attack which means I’m in excruciating pain and parts of my body are dying that I’ll never get back, to the extent where because of this new attack, I have to get a hip replacement later this year because of the avascular necrosis happening on my femoral heads. So I text my managers letting them know the situation & what do I get? “Oh no I’m so sorry that happened! You need to find someone to cover your shifts or else we’ll have to shut the game down for the morning, also gonna need some type of medical documentation” and the Kill Bill siren immediately started playing in my head.

Thankfully being a 100% disabled vet, I can afford to ghost this employer and chill out til I find a better job but Jesus Christ I can’t believe how much empathy people have lost nowadays.

this is going to be a bit long, so bear with me. We both work at the same place in California. 
Last Tuesday, we were out due to my father having a medical emergency. Friday, I tested positive for Covid and left with my partner early about 4 hours in. 
I worked from home Monday while he was off, because he can’t work from home. We came in Tuesday, worked a full shift. Wednesday, after an hour into my shift, I passed out in the office. HR sent us to 3 emergency locations and then told us this was not covered from the company because it was not a work-related accident, so we ended up going to the emergency room that would be covered by our own insurance. The ER doc told me I was having complications with Covid, and stressed out, so to stay home. I got a doctor’s note for being out for 6 hours Wednesday, and for complete days off Thursday/Friday. 
My partner had a fever flare up from Covid so he called out Thursday and since it had been less than 24 hrs with a fever, he called out Friday (today.)
Mind you, we have over 100 hours of sick time we never touch. We never take sick days so taking this much time off is unheard of for us.
I get a call at 5pm today, Friday, from the two CEOs saying they received from other employees there that I had been talking ill of other employees via group messages. I told them no, I haven’t, I would not do that. They kept repeating the question until finally I said maybe before I was a manager or when I was frustrated but I’ve always been mindful of my interactions with others as a manager. I asked if they were fabricated, they said no, but wouldn’t offer me proof. They terminated me and I felt like I got backed into a corner into saying what they wanted me to say, plus I did not feel well and had a note to be off work today.
My partner messaged one of them on Slack 5 hours later (we will call him Adam). He asked Adam if they had proof, and that this is really putting us in a hard place and we could lose our home. Adam said he had to sleep and my partner said he is lucky he can sleep with no worries about a roof over his head. 
Pete, the other CEO, messaged my partner and said he is the point of contact going forward. My partner asked why, and he said “it’s me.”
My partner made a group message with both the CEOs and said no, I’m talking to both of you, I’m not talking to Pete alone and proceeded to again say how much we have done for the company and he wanted proof.
Pete said that since he didn’t listen to him, he is terminating him effectively immediately and they can mail his last check. My partner then sent two screenshots of other employees saying bad things in group messages and asked if they would be firing them too. 
His slack was deactivated immediately.
So now here we are, both jobless and stressed. We work for a small company, have worked there 3 years, and they do shady stuff all the time. At one point there were rumors of tax evasion and that they have several businesses under their name so they can’t be found. 
I’m really trying to grapple with what text messages they were shown because I can’t find any, and maybe I could have said something two years ago before I was a manager and before we had HR?
Idk- how does all this sound? I promise I won’t take anything as legal advice. I also feel like if they didn’t want to discuss it in the moment with my partner, they could’ve paused their slack notifications and revised it Monday. "

for some context, my dog died in march and I took a couple of days off because I was completely devastated, I wasn’t in any state to concentrate on work. when I returned to work I was told that those days were being filed as compassionate leave, meaning they’re unpaid but wouldn’t be punishable and no further action would be taken. 

about a month ago, I had a week off work due to illness and when I returned I received a letter informing me of an ‘investigation’ into my pattern of absences. I use quotes because this is a company known for their lack of transparency or thoroughness and they’re especially not fair when it comes to treatment of staff (and then wonder why morale is so low). 

long story short: they couldn’t find any pattern, turns out they’d just looked at my total absences from 2017 to now without context and assumed wrongdoing and the whole thing gets thrown out. 

cut to today, I was called into a meeting and was told that actually, the company *will* be taking action against me for those days in march because the manager who told me otherwise was simply mistaken and didn’t follow the correct process, completely disregarding the fact it wasn’t my fault whatsoever and stripping away every human element possible. I was given a 3 month verbal warning which strips of you your sick pay entitlement for the duration, essentially a probationary period. 

I cannot believe how low they sank just to try and get something on me, like their error was *my* fault. at the end I even asked the hearing manager if they’re a genuine human person because of how cold it all was. I’m not one to lose my rag with people very often but this crossed a line. 

on the advice from my union representative I will be appealing this absolutely disgusting decision and putting in a grievance with the people responsible. not a fucking chance I’m going to let them punish me for this, not one. "

This was despite me not being paid for half my shifts and repeatedly not being told important information about the job. I needed the money so I kept working no matter what.

What pushed it over the line was one day I turned up and the doors were locked, I waited outside for half an hour and nothing, so I went home. Then I get an email telling me to come in for a meeting, I did and I ended up getting fired for ""costing the company money"" by not coming in. I explained that I came and waited for half an hour but apparently it was my fault for not calling them even though they know what time I'm supposed to be there. So I'm not paid, not told important information and locked out of my job, then fired for not doing a job they locked me out of, all of my loyalty and hard work now means nothing.

I didn't come by the day after but I did tell my mom I was quitting, to be honest I felt really guilty about all of this, I didn't want to let down the guy my mom relied on to get me this job, I didn't want to disappoint my family members or anything but I couldn't put up with others concern before my own anymore

I feel like my mom was more disappointed at the fact that I can't earn money anymore to help her out, given like every day she asks me if I earned any good tips more the times than she asked about my well being.


After I quit, the workplace called my mom and got told off as to why I broke their club car, going back by 5 days I did a few test runs with the car my co-worker gave to me in secret I didn't have a permit and the car was simple enough to drive with so it should have been fine, then the day or the second after, my co-worker gave me an errand to deliver luggage, on the way back I slightly scratched the car under it by some pipe or something, I didn't think anything of it and that's the only minor injury I think I did.


After I quit by 3 or so like days my co-worker called me and asked me if I damaged the car because he says its not working anymore, I don't believe I did anything to it but he asked me if I injured it or anything and if I was responsible, he told me that he wouldn't report me or anything so its fine, now I didn't believe nor want to believe that a minor scratch was what damaged the car but I told him anyway because I trusted him

After then I found out he called on me to the boss and everything went downhill, the man that got me in the job got was humiliated by his boss and my mom as well, she berated me on about how she didn't want to lose her connection because of me and how I'm a failure compared to my other siblings, I felt really traumatised because of that.

I can't trust anyone anymore and don't feel like working again anytime soon.


Ps: my mom is divorced, single and with 3 kids, eldest 20, middle (me) 18, youngest 14

Just 3 years back I was mentally unfunctionable and struggled to even say a word or 2, I thought I grew up alot since then but turns out I didn't grow at all, because my mom said I'm not a man I'm a little child while she berated me.

I've already called in for today, he then sends me a text asking where I'm at, that he expects me to be in tomorrow.

I'm from Italy and I have some questions about general income/lifestyle in USA after watching latest video of Johnny Harris. In the video he shows off various type of income lifestyle such as:
1. 25k (of gross income per year)
2.40k
3. 100K
4.1 million
5. 25 million

The case 1. and 2. are actually terrible, barely surviving and paying off debts, car, house expenses and food (can we say working poor?). The case 3. goes on with a quiet comfy life but can't put aside so much in savings The case 4. and 5. are not so common and l'm not even interested into investigating further.

Do you relate to all of this? Is it really so difficult surviving in the States despite of work? I was born with the idea of the American Dream, land of million opportunities, of making a ton of money with hard work and effort. I feel like all of this dream just fell down in million pieces...

527,2024-07-27,Teacher Passed Over Twice For Own Position ,u/the_miss1ng_s0ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1edhdv1/teacher_passed_over_twice_for_own_position/,antiwork,"Here is the nightmare that I am currently going through in my district. This is a doozy and I have never, ever been more insulted in my life. 

TL;DR: Got passed over twice for external candidates, for MY OWN JOB. 

I have spent five years in my current position as a traveling teacher, .5/.5 between two middle schools, coteaching 7-8 math. At each school I coteach with a 1.0 teacher who is full time at that school. Since the start of my career, I have aspired to move into one of those 1.0 roles because I want my own program and to not travel anymore. It has been my professional aim 100% since traveling teachers are treated like trash in my district. When one of my 1.0 colleagues announced his retirement this year, I thought this was it. I have a great record of success in my own district, great observations, and always go above and beyond for the two schools I’m at. 

In my district, lately, teachers have to interview for transfer against external employees. I didn’t think much of that because this position is literally in my classroom, teaching my own students - I’d be a shoe-in, right? Had a great interview then a great demo lesson. Waited weeks to hear back from my boss. I finally hear back, and they went with the external candidate. For literally the same job I have been doing for five years in my classroom, just 1.0 instead of .5.  

Slap in the face number one. 

I meet with my boss and am told “you are valued” and am encouraged to continue applying for other positions in district. I waited out the year, and at the end of June it came out that the person rejected the offer. I sent my boss several messages about my interest in reapplying and spent almost the entire month of July preparing for my interview so I could have it down pat. 

Well, two days ago HR reached out and let me know I’m actually not eligible to re-interview because in my district internal candidates can’t interview twice for the same position. This would have been really great to know when I alerted my boss to the fact that I was re-applying, you know, before I spent half the summer preparing for it. 

Slap in the face number 2. 

When the opening was reposted, the closing date was pushed back several times, presumably due to lack of applicants. Slap in the face number 3 will occur when somebody fresh out of college with zero experience steps into the role I’ve been working towards for my whole career because that’s the only person who applied. 

Anyway, this is why I’m looking for a new job. Administrators, take notes. This is how you lose people. I started out this process confident that my district would attempt to do right by its teachers. I now know that is not the case.

5,2024-07-27,resigning if remote work not given ,u/CaptainPBee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1edi0ya/resigning_if_remote_work_not_given/,antiwork,"hi, I need some solid advice/experiences 

I joined a startup fairly recent <1 year. very small team.

It was an in-office role. Over time I've realised that I want to do things of my own (I'm building my own business as-well). I'm literally spending 10+ hours including commute at this job. I feel stressed, depressed because of it makes me feel. I can't do anything else at this job other than pretend I am working. Which is another point, nothing there excites me at all. And I hardly work for 2 hours. Rest is all day pretending to work. Neither do I enjoy the work there, and I feel terrible sitting in a cubicle for 10 hours when I could be using that time to do something of my own.

I am thinking of asking the company for a remote role. None of them work remotely so I'd be the first person to work remotely. And if they dont allow me, I am going to resign. (my role can be performed 100% remotely).  
  
Getting a new remote job isn't an issue for me since I have references I can use.

Part I am concerned about:

It's a fairly new job I joined and in the interview I had mentioned that I would love to work from the office because I was desperate to get this job. But things have changed and in a negative way. I'm starting to suffocate to go to the office now.

It's a small company so I am kinda of close to the founder. I am having really tough time on how to ask for this and what reasons to give. And if I would burn bridges.

I might be overthinking but at this point its taking a toll on my health.

Has anyone ever faced an issue like this or had a similar experience.

Thanks"

But honestly, I am even less engaged than I used to be and have even less patience for the corporate BS. I think now that I have seen what life is like without the BS, it's been hard to re-integrate it back in my life. I used to be the star employee leading a team, and now I have taken a step back in an operational role fully WFH, that is less stressful than before. So maybe I shouldn't complain, but I can't stand the environment and don't relate to the people at all. I am completely uninterested in learning or any kind of growth or showing initiative. I feel like I'm playing the role of somebody who cares, and I just look forward to turning that off at the end of the day. It's soul-sucking, but I have bills to pay. I'm trying to reframe the way I look at things, and try to focus my energy more on my personal goals and activities. But 40 hours a week is a lot of time!

Colleague snitched on me saying he isnt working from home. Despite attending his codr review meeting, told him i can review again once better connection but still escalates.

In the following meeting with boss, my boss started with aggressive interrogation and i blurted out the wronf llocation when it was airport due to social anxiety. I realised that I made a mistake and told the actual location when my nerves calmed down as i coudnt think straight.

Worked through remaining day there and dorve back an hour to work through late evening.

Boss then becomes micromanagerial, plays favourites with colleagur, shouts in front of him, and says you are too junior for a senior role. Then starts asking who takes of kids and how you go to mosque etc.

He esclates this to HR and have been for 10 days on paid suspension. Had two informal and a neutral step before formal with a union member.

Boss also stated he found no issues on work performance. But has pulled up 3 incidents over past 1.5 years of working to make me look bad when i have apologised for each one and he acknowledged it in the messages. 

Boss also relying on my colleague to rate my SQL to junior when i face the first project was all done and SQL heavy.

Now boss is contorting:
Labour theft saying i take 1 hour of lunch break when in fact i just work through it - claims no employer pays 1hour for lunch in whole UK
Not informing him of location
Basic sql knowledge and defending him unjustly
Relying too much on teammates? They did it out of their own goodwill
Ip logs showed all locations were london cause he hasnt got a vlue how ip works

I told boss i work through lunch. It doesnt go through his head that this is also a possibility. 

Im enjoying being paid free suspension fot ober 10 days now before decision day on Wed but this is stressful.

After Wed it can drag more than two weeks for union to come to formal. I should have a new job by then.

I have been writing articles for one magazine for many years, always using one of these languages which is more minority-related but still understood by the majority. It has never been a problem and I have never been asked to switch languages.

We recently got a new chief editor who has done some changes but I wasn't affected. He has been satisfied with my work and wanted me to continue as usual which I did. No problems until the latest issue of the magazine was published. To my horror, I discovered that my article was translated to another language without my knowledge, very poorly, with grammatical errors and even some incorrect facts. And it was published under my name with no other name. Given the topic, the last thing I was are such errors in something I have supposedly written. Nobody has told me anything and the magazine is already out.

I am absolutely livid that they would do something to me and not even tell me. I wouldn't mind switching to another language if anyone has bothered to ask me. Now this errors-riddled thing which was likely just thrown into the Google Translator is published under my name. I have already sent a very angry email to the chief editor, but it's the weekend now, so I don't expect to hear back soon. I plan to call him next week.

I hate to lose something I have been doing for years as my part-time job, but if this happens again, I don't think I can keep going."

Yet today she pulled me aside to accuse of me of several things, which include:

1. Talking back to a customer on the phone, which I know for a fact I did not do that at all. I asked about the day this happened and she only gave me vague details, in which the only incident I can think of when a customer showed up at the wrong store to get their order. They also came after the To-Go area had closed for the day so they would have had to deal with the manager on duty to get their order. 

  
2. Claimed that I forgot items and bags for a customer consistently, Karen complained twice apparently that I had done so for her order. Which again, I am pretty sure is false, because she seemed to be the only one complaining according to my meeting today. What more than likely happened was we simply didn't have some of the items she ordered in stock. In which there were no adequate replacements in some cases. Which again, if I am correct I actually worked with the customer that day to find replacements in a timely and polite fashion.

3. Showed me a sheet that has our metrics that show our performance, in which a score of 1 or below is what's needed, in which I was literally at 1.02, and two others were much higher than that. Yet of course she lied and said only one other person was higher than that, when I could see the sheet. Oh and this was brought to my attention months later instead of sooner as this was an issue initially in which I picked up the pace as requested and was told when I asked several times I was doing fine.  

4. Told me that some people have claimed I have the personality of a stop sign, which in a way is a bit true. I am a very introverted, reserved person, doesn't help that I have ADHD either, yet again while I don't act like a cheerleader when dealing with customers. I am cordial and polite, but that's an easy fix honestly as I can be more extroverted as needed when dealing with customers. 

5. Claimed that I don't want to work, when I do, or else I wouldn't be showing up for four hours a day, two days a week like I am. I also wouldn't be about to start two new jobs, because I just OBVIOUSLY don't want to work at all. 

All of the above was in a write up I got today BTW, which if all of the above was true should have meant that I would have been terminated. Yet miss ""good manager"", her words not mine, didn't, because she's trying to silent fire me, like she's done to other people, which is an incredibly shitty thing to do to say the least. This is also why people don't want to work for corporations either, you have super strict rules, and shitty managers that make the work environment a misery. That isn't to say that all my managers are bad, the bulk of them I like and are reasonable and fair. Yet miss main manager is a horrendous wreck, as the other fun habit she has is she will yell at you when you ask her about something related to the job. When its her literal fucking job to be a manager, and she blatantly is not suited to do that at all with the way she acts and behaves. 

The silver lining is I have two new jobs lined up, although I seem to be dealing with another bad manager as they have not reached out to me at all to ask about my availability. In which I have made attempts to start working and training but they just keep beating around the bush. The other job though is for a much better place of work and actually has a start date for me which I am looking forward to!

As the title says ""How do I make the world better"" I'm more-so thinking about this in large-scale change but what can I do to help reduce the amount of exploitation that happens? I work in a factory for a massive company with 200+ workers and we all earn just above minimum wage while we are pumping out hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of product. The company keeps growing and stock prices go up but the labour that makes the profits doesn't see any of the benefits.

Housing prices all over the prices are outrageous. I've already bought a property so I know decreasing prices will only help other people and actively serve to my detriment but what can I do to help lower the price so others can enjoy such a basic right as housing?

  
The 4 day work week is such an amazing idea what can I do in order to help make it happen?

I know I can do things like protest but that feels like it does nothing. I also know I can volunteer but as a net impact on the world, I think working even more would destroy my mental health so much that it would make my life much worse than it would help. I know I can donate but I don't have money to spend as I'm young and a uni student."

I just started working at a gas station that is a private owned franchise a little over two weeks ago. I was told that I would get paid yesterday along with the other employees on pay day. 
When I showed up for my shift I asked my coworker for my check and he told me that the manager had forgot to make one for me. Obviously I was upset and asked the manager what was up. She had told me that I didn’t fill out the tax forms so she was not able to make me a check.
I had been working two weeks and asked if I needed to sign any papers or tax forms like I normally do for a job and was told no. I was given them yesterday by a coworker.
My manager told me that I would be getting paid a handwritten check next week untaxed, but I was really counting on my money to be here the day it was supposed to. 
We went back and forth and she agreed to pay me cash that day, then later called back telling my coworker to just fill me out a check that they had left for the vendors. 
This coworker is not a supervisor or manager and has never filled a check before. Ok whatever though, I will take the check and cash it in the morning. 
The issuing bank would not cash the check because the handwriting does not match any previous check cashed from them. 
I call my manager and she says it’s not her ducking problem and that she paid me so she doesn’t care. I mentioned that I didn’t want to have to call the labor board and she got angry and yelled at me and fired me. 
I was able return the check today to the store and was paid for part of my time there. I had to return my keys and uniform and she wants me to go in Monday to talk. 

Is this like not seriously illegal or am I trippin?"

I segued into education from bedside critical care (nearly 10 yrs) a few yrs ago after a major life change. At the time, I was just happy to be away from bedside, which had a myriad of issues. During my time with the school, I have played a major role in its running/ formation and improved overall cohesion. I have been rewarded for my hardwork with more work, consistently. From creating classes/ content for the bulk of one program, to being moved into another newly started program, only to have to consistently feel as though I shoulder the bulk of the burden. 

Our students are able to act completely inappropriately, often bullying staff and other students, which goes unpunished. I have been there longer than my boss, who was once a friend of mine, but has become one of the uncaring, unsupportive admins we used to collectively abhor. 

I began wearing headphones during office time a few months ago to decrease my exposure to the constant office drama/politics and have been treated pretty poorly since. I received the worst review of my career earlier this yr form said former friend. I requested a meeting with the goal of an actionable roadmap to achieve higher scores and was met with vapidness. I must be in a constant state of self deprication to not anger my manager, who then withholds important information and ultimately makes my job harder and uncomfortable. 

I work a part time education job remotely as well, and have always dreamed of quitting the school and expanding my remote role, and due to recent events of blatant disrespect I don’t feel like I can wait any longer. 

The problem: my current benefits are amazing . My pay is trash but my insurance and retirement prospects are great. My husband supports me and wants me to be happy, and while we could live solely on his income (it would be very tight) I am trepidatious about giving up my pension. 

I guess I need advice that doesn’t incorporate my emotions, I’m afraid of making a huge mistake.

I have been severely depressed at work and it has contributed greatly to my performance. I have been working almost non-stop for maybe more than 2 years now. I've had a couple of staycations, but after driving out maybe 4 hours out of my state, I feel like this vacation is more exceptional. 

I got to see more places, separate myself from my work, not have to dread about Monday around the corner, and I got to do fun stuff without worrying about my job or my finances. Yes, I had to get a loan to afford the trip and the hotel room had shitty wifi, but still a breath of fresh air to my corporate routine. 

I know that many of us working class cannot afford the luxury that I received, and I had to make some sacrifices in order to make it feasible. I am in the middle of transitioning out of my current job, because I have a micromanaging HR department, and the culture just isn't a great fit. 

I have 2 more weeks before I go back to my crappy job, but I hope that before then I can find a job where I can be trained up and not deal with people that are criticizing your every decision.

I began working here almost three months ago, and I am good at my job. I have received nothing but positive feedback from management and coworkers other than minor service notes that I’ve listened to and improved upon, and I work hard and pull my weight. I know that my performance actually cannot be part of the issue here. For the past 2 months I’ve been working 4 days a week, typically scheduled for around 24 hours give or take. It’s a tipped position and there’s often cuts so it’s hard to measure exactly. 
As of a week and a half ago, we changed our hours to no longer stay open for lunch on Fridays so I lost that shift, but I didn’t say anything beyond a brief conversation with my manager and was fine with three. A few days later my manager took me off my one consistently good shift, which I explicitly asked her not to do, but she made it seem like her hands were tied and it was the only way to get everyone enough hours. I was frustrated but didn’t say anything beyond what I had already said about wanting to keep the shift and she promised me two weekdays to make up for it, so I would still be working 4 days. 
As of today, a coworker of mine was talking about how she all of a sudden was only on once a week. I told her to go talk to the manager because that’s obviously not okay. So she did that, and afterward my manager approached me and explained that she made a mistake. My coworker had said she “was okay with anything” for her shifts when they were reworking the schedule, and for some reason my manager took that as a go-ahead to only schedule her once a week. I think it’s pretty clear that wasn’t what she meant, but I digress. My manager explained that she had offered me those shifts under the impression that my coworker didn’t want them, but now that she does she apparently has a claim to them because of “seniority”and I will only have two shifts per week, cutting my hours in half, effective tomorrow. I was caught really off guard by this considering my performance has been good, and I didn’t really advocate for myself in the moment because I felt like I was about to cry. She offered me a hosting shift to make up for it but I’m not a hostess, I’m a server and she hired me to be a server. Even if I did take the hosting shift this pay cut is still crazy. I can’t live on this. I need to find another job but I start school in a month and won’t be able to work as much.  I really needed this month of work to save up and I don’t have time to find another job where I could do that.

4,2024-07-28,New management,u/Sweetie9889,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ee2675/new_management/,antiwork,"Hello, 

I need advice on the best option going forward. 

I work at a franchised restaurant in California. The station I work in consists of 1-4 people per shift and we make our own tips. We average $10-15 per shift. We’re the only station that doesn’t get tipped out by servers. The closing team member has to take out the station’s trash, restock and wipe down the counter. I get paid 16.50/ hr (since the beginning) and I’ve been the designated person to train everybody that joins my station (about 10 people) since I started working there (1 year). I’ve since come to find out that all of my new coworkers make $17.50.

Now, with new management, she wants the closing team member to throw out all of back of house trash, mop the floors, and clean the counters which was previously done by the 1 food runner. And any down time we have we’re expected to run food for the servers. The food runner makes $18/ hr + averages $80+ in tips per shift and gets to go home by 10pm without any cleaning. 

I went to the new manager and asked her if it was possible to raise my wage to $18 since everybody else makes more than $16.50. She asked me who I heard that from and then proceeded to tell me we shouldn’t be talking about our wages. She settled on $17.50 and then pretty much told me that I should accept the new changes and be grateful towards her for giving me a “raise”. 

I forgot to mention that I close 4-5 days per week and the restaurant closes at 12am. My availability since the beginning has been until 12am but with the extra cleaning I’d probably be there until 1am. I have another job that starts at 7am. She’s adamant about the cleaning and even went as far to say she doesn’t care how long it takes, it will get done and if someone clocks out, she’ll make them clock back in. 

Please tell me there’s unfairness in the situation, because most people don’t really see  it. The extra work isn’t hard, but the pay isn’t fair and why should we be helping the stations that receive extra tips from a pool were not a part of? It’s not like they reciprocate the help when needed. 

What would be the best way to fuck her over?? I know there are no laws against disclosing wages to coworkers, so I’ve been telling coworkers about pay differences. Nothing exists to help with going against availability. They could just schedule me less… I’m on time and rarely call out and have had no write ups so I don’t think I could be fired that easily.

1,2024-07-28,New job offer,u/MrBrownIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ee3wof/new_job_offer/,antiwork,"Hi Reddit, I got a new job offer.

Me:
M, 32 years old, Electrical designer for special machinery in the automotive and pharma sectors.


The offer:
40k in a multinational + Benefits, defense sector (quite a high offer for someone like me who doesn't have an engineering degree), passed tests and selections, apparently they want to invest in me, well, their loss 😂

I want to clarify that I wasn't looking for another job, they contacted me through LinkedIn.


Where I'm coming from:
Small artisan company, owner always in the office following all the projects, delegating the bare minimum, 30k on paper, low base salary boosted with minimal mileage reimbursements, meal vouchers, and other perks. As a result, despite a high net salary, I have very low contributions.
Here I would be the head of design with two people under me to manage (an engineer and an intern), theoretically, because as I said, the owner doesn't trust and doesn't delegate, he only trusts the 2/3 long-time employees who often lack the technical skills to make decisions, they frequently rely on me and take the credit, and I am often unaware of some things regarding the projects I follow.


Why I'm considering it? Pros and Cons
Cons:
The new company is 100km from my home, so I would have to face 200km daily with a monthly cost of 500€, whether I travel or relocate. So my salary would remain the same.

Another aspect is the emotional one, my girlfriend works in the public sector, so a government job, in the town where we currently live (10 minutes by car).
All our future plans would go on standby at best, or if we want to be catastrophic, right down the drain.

Pros:
It's a multinational, which means work quality standards, I wouldn't have to manage 10 projects simultaneously anymore, I wouldn't have to work 12-hour days hearing the classic joke ""half-day today?"" when I leave, I wouldn't have to worry about last-minute deliveries anymore, but most importantly, I wouldn't have to answer to the owner if I chose a technical solution that costs 10€ more.

Continuous training, mandatory English course, management and work organization course, courses of choice in any field (subject to approval).

An internal policy ensures that the gross annual salary increases automatically by 5k every 5 years.

What I think:
My choice leans towards staying where I am, even though I won't have future growth opportunities, simply to not lose what my girlfriend and I have built together. I don't feel like asking her to move again to an area that is neither too far for me nor too far for her, we've already done it in the past and I believe it can be very dangerous in the long run.

I’m still holding onto the hope that we’ll get our salaries but I can’t help but think that she’s trying to get us to do free labor & “disappear” once our notice period ends.

I dunno. It feels like everything is just up in the air right now.

I asked regarding our salary a few weeks ago but she said she’ll let me know when she gets an update about it but so far there’s nothing.

Thoughts? I just don’t wanna end things on a bad note by ghosting or lashing out or stoop to their level of unprofessionalism."

**Awareness Guide for Workplace Dynamics and Risk Management**

Disclaimer:

The following guide is for awareness purposes only and is not intended as a recommendation or encouragement to engage in any of the described behaviors. Understanding these dynamics can help you recognize and navigate complex workplace situations. 

**Identifying and Reporting Potential Risks**

Managing out team members or mitigating potential risks such as lawsuits, team morale issues driven by one person, or misconduct around integrity can be highly time-consuming and prolonged. If you independently identify such risks and report them to your manager, framing it as a ""good faith"" observation made out of concern for the wider team, you may gain favor with your manager and help eliminate potential threats.

**Creating and Substantiating Issues**

If no real issues are apparent, you might be tempted to fabricate them. Using others as a second opinion to substantiate these claims can create a veneer of credibility, but ensure you lead the narrative.

**Addressing Performance Issues**

If a team member's performance drops due to their imminent departure or lack of motivation, offer to assist them with your manager's approval. Identify their shortcomings and attribute them to performance issues rather than effort. This provides your manager with a second opinion and an easier route to manage the situation.

**Navigating Team Tensions**

Identify tensions between teammates, particularly those who pose less of a threat to your career progression. Befriend the less threatening party, confirm their frustrations, and encourage them to speak with your manager. Fabricating additional concerns can put the problematic individual under closer scrutiny.

**Mentoring New Hires**

Offering to mentor new hires can position you as a diligent and supportive team member. However, onboarding them incorrectly and documenting their learning challenges can create a perception of risk that your manager will appreciate you identifying. Further, by sowing discord and positioning yourself as a supportive figure, you can manipulate team dynamics to your advantage.

**Managing Individuals on Leave**

Individuals returning from maternity leave or extended breaks are often slow to ramp up and may be on HR's radar. Reporting alleged offensive or discriminatory statements made by them can lead to investigations and lower morale, ensuring HR oversight.

**Leveraging Protected Class Status**

If you belong to a protected class, such as mental health or addiction, and this status is not visibly apparent, strategically disclosing it only when necessary can be advantageous. This can create grounds for discrimination allegations against your manager or competing teammates.

**Strategic Use of Medical Leave**

Taking medical leave right before performance reviews or end-of-year evaluations can complicate your manager's review process. Sending complex emails about work, embedding requests for time off due to disability, and using such communications to claim retaliation if not promoted can be a strategic move.

**Documenting Discrimination**

Wait for a coworker to make an inappropriate comment about your protected class. Casually discuss it with another coworker to have it acknowledged by a third party, and then claim discrimination.

**Disrupting Team Dynamics**

Use your disability status to take extended leave, briefly return, and then leave again. This can disrupt your manager's forecasts and expectations, creating complications for their planning.

**Long and Critical Emails**

Writing detailed and critical emails to HR about your work environment, including mention of your protected class status, can prompt HR to offer a settlement to avoid potential lawsuits.

**Peer Reviews**

Before a colleague leaves, consider giving them a negative peer review that they won't see but will go on their employee record.

**Stress-Related Accommodations**

Requesting an accommodation due to stress related to a disability right before a deadline can hinder your team's progress. Ensuring you have the necessary files can further complicate their efforts.

—————

*This guide outlines potential workplace dynamics and risk management tactics. Be aware of these behaviors and consider the ethical implications and long-term consequences of engaging in such practices.*

I realized we see so many people working their jobs and we dont see what they have on their plate. We just have our own expectations and we get frustrated that they dont do what service to us they should. 

Ive rarely been pressed with time in any of my jobs, i work very fast and hard. But this summer, im working on summer vacation house cleaning and we have a few hours to single-handedly run through a long checklist, where we just dont have the time. And then i get complaints later on when i missed something because ive been running around all stressed out, not even eating during my entire shift because we dont have the time for that. Coming home, poor pay, exhausted, really just wanting to sleep right away and just having energy to do nothing after my work. I feel like a complete slave and its like they want us to feel guilty for doing everything we can, and even a lot more than our pay suggests we should? 

Just to give a perspective, i have 2 hours to clean a 1600 square foot house all on my own. Every customer ive met theyre confused what our duties are, as they have all found poorly cleaned houses from my coworkers. I have even found papers detailing everything that wasnt cleaned properly laying around the houses where the guests decided to clean it on their own. Its like any company ive been in, the top dont care about their customers and especially not their workers. But surely, they will get their slice of the cake no matter what while sometimes you have to be starving all day long at work because thats how much time they gave you. "

The Boomers parents/grandparents fought hard to bring in labor laws that significantly improved working conditions for the Baby Boomers. And they kept the fight up for themselves. But now, it feels like the Boomers have forgotten those hard-won battles and aren't advocating for us in the same way.

It's disheartening to see that everyone seems to be looking out for themselves these days. The sense of solidarity that generations before us had is sorely lacking. If we want things to get better, we need to band together and support each other. But it seems the younger generation struggles with this the most.

Why is it that the Boomers, who benefited so much from their parents/grandparents efforts, aren't stepping up to do the same for us? And lead by example. They should remember what their elders did for them and continue that legacy of fighting for better working conditions and fair treatment."

Eventually, he started paying me late, but I stuck around for two years because of my poor financial situation and being the sole provider for my family.

I found another job, but when I asked for an experience letter, he refused, saying he had no HR and that he’d look into it in four months.

now I'm employee of his 2 companies working for him at this new company, I told him that if I get a new job, I need a 3-year experience letter.

1748,2024-07-28,Fellow US worker: you don't have a job,u/AlternativeAd7151,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ee9r49/fellow_us_worker_you_dont_have_a_job/,antiwork,"I know this is a hard concept to grasp, but many of the ""jobs"" American redditors comment about in this group wouldn't even be considered jobs anywhere else. You see, a job usually has a minimum of labor protections and guaranteed hours and compensation in a lot of countries around the world. 

And I'm not talking just the European developed world, either. Even third world countries (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, etc) do not classify as a job any work you engage in that doesn't have minimum of protection and security. We have yearly or monthly contracts, but hourly contracts are extremely rare and restricted to professionals like consultants or lawyers. Project-based contractors also exist, but are often ruled in court to be a form of misclassification of employment contracts (to evade labor protections and taxes) and sanctioned, not a part of the legal labor framework.

Those crazy schedules with changing shifts and no minimum guaranteed hours you have as a burger flipper? Those are likely illegal in the third world and formally incorporated companies cannot hire anyone under those conditions. Those are considered side hustles or gigs you can only do on the side in the informal sector of the economy. It's not considered a normal thing to have two or more ""jobs"" just to make ends meet in the third world. You either have a job, or you do gigs in the informal sector because you couldn't get a job.

In sum, it seems to me that the US masks a higher informality rate than is officially acknowledge by legalizing precarious gigs and calling them ""jobs"". What are your thoughts on it?"

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.

I’ve been working remotely for a company that’s based in the US. My boss and team believe I’m working from the US, but the truth is I’ve been staying in Europe. Recently, I suffered an eye injury that made it really difficult to work. When I informed my boss about the injury, they suggested I take short-term disability leave. I initially declined, thinking I could manage my workload despite the injury.

Fast forward a week, and I was suddenly fired. There wasn’t much explanation given, but it felt really abrupt and, frankly, unfair. Now I’m left wondering if I should pursue any legal action. The problem is, I’m scared to do anything because my boss didn’t know I was in Europe, and I’m worried this might complicate things or even backfire on me.

Has anyone here faced a similar situation or have any advice on what steps I should take? I feel like I was unjustly let go, but I’m also anxious about the potential consequences of revealing my actual location.

Thanks in advance for any help or insights you can provide!

**TL;DR:** Got an eye injury while working remotely. Boss thought I was in the US and suggested short-term disability. I declined and was fired a week later. Scared to take legal action because my boss didn’t know my real location. Need advice."

The job had also been pretty rough for the past few months - felt like I was being blamed for  issues beyond my control, and that stress combined with grief made work feel impossible. Once they gave me the lowest rating in my yearly review, less than two months after I got back from bereavement leave, I knew I had to gtfo. They even said that my performance declined during the month that I was away for most of on bereavement leave... like... yeah? Obviously?

The immediate improvement to my mental health is so much stronger than any anxiety about the future - I really needed out. Figured out healthcare over the past week, and even though money may be tight for a bit I've been saving for this so I'm feeling confident.

No way I'm gonna work at a college again. At this point, I'm down to do pretty much anything but that.

23,2024-07-28,I love work (not),u/Devedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eeda5l/i_love_work_not/,antiwork,"First six months at my job were great. New responsibilities, more variety of work, I was managing field crews — basically everything I needed to move my career forward. After that, the worse place I've ever worked.

One week after I first started, the guy that was suppose to be my manager resigned. He was really nice and said he had this was in the works and he was sorry for leaving on such short notice. So, instead of him as my manager, I got Villain (I'm a writer so I'm just going to call her Villain). A little bit about Villain, she has no idea what she is doing, but she pretends to know. Classic fake it till you make it situation. Can't even answer basic questions with answering with another question.

About a month after starting, Villain hired a low-level drafter to help the office out (there was only three people working in our particular office). I helped train him, he seemed to be doing fine, but Villain HATED him. When I asked how he was doing, Villain always had a reason to be mad at him. She also made inappropriate comments about what he was wearing, how he talked and how he wrote emails. She assigned him to the most menial, confusing task in existence and when he tried to call for help she would ignore him (I tested this by calling right after he tried calling multiple times and she would answer for me). So I helped train him on it, we create a template together and he got through it. Villain fired him a couple weeks later for reasons I never understood.

At this point I've seen the red flags and started taking steps to protect myself. Five months later, Villain starts acting weird around me. MFW it's my turn. In a meeting with all my coworkers (some from other offices and some new hires), Villain says ""Okay OP, if you get done with your task, don't just sit there for four hours and do nothing."" Out of the blue. My coworker speaks up to defend me, but I just take it with stride. In a meeting with a sub-contractor going over some QC (quality control) work, she tells the sub-contractor that I am lying to him (?) and that I didn't QC an area of the project. Sub-contractor and I are friends, so we talk about it later. We agree he should just go check it again anyway to appease her. Surprise surprise, I QC'd it and everything was how it should be.

A few weeks later we take a trip to a job site up in Napa. Standard stuff, walk the site, help the field crews get started, take some pictures blah blah blah. Everything goes fine. On the drive back Villain wants to grab some food so we stop. During food eating, Villain says she is giving me a formal warning because of communication, saying that I don't check in or check out every day (I work hybrid). Total nonsense since we can go into our chat logs and see that I do check in and out every day. I take a screenshot of the chat logs then continue on with my life.

Month continues and she steadily gets worse. Making sh\*tty comments to my coworkers in front of me, talking behind my back. Petty stuff that I don't have an issue making note of and ignoring.

Then it happened. The big one. Villain and I were talking about the same subcontractor work mentioned above. She says 'you didn't have the field crews check this area. It's clear you don't have the experience needed to do this job properly.' Normally I would have brushed it off, but this particular area she told me specifically to ignore since it was outside of our scope. Realizing that she was now actively trying to sabotage me, I did the unthinkable. I glared at her.

She backs up in her chair and puts her hands in the air as if I'm holding a gun to her head. ""I can't do this anymore, this is ridiculous."" I say ""Agreed."" She storms off and calls the regional manager, filing a complaint that I was physically intimidating her. Regional manager says to stay away from each other for now and he will come down to the office the following week to talk with us both.

I am looking forward to the talk so I can show Mr. Regional manager all the sh\*t she has been doing and hopefully get transferred to another branch. Regional manager arrives only for me to learn that Villain filed another complaint about me and he was now there to give me a written warning and explain that I'm on a PIP now. I stay silent the entire meeting as they talk at me. At the end of the meeting I say. ""That's it? That's all you came here for? We're done?"" He says yeah, but he is perceptive and realizes something else is going on. They leave, but he comes back alone and I get to talk to him briefly. I explain what's been happening and he tells me to send him an email with all my complaints.

Regional manager takes a larger role in upcoming project and is in on all the calls. Villain accuses me of saying I will do something, but I don't. During the call where she is accusing me, I suggest we bring regional manager into the call and she agrees (big mistake on her part). Regional manager knows Villain is lying, so they have a conversation.

Happy ending: I get removed from all chat groups, told to not talk with anyone outside of my new direct supervisor. My new supervisor has less experience than I do and does not have the certification I have. Villain keeps calling my new direct supervisor complaining about me, saying I don't know what I am doing and should be removed from all projects. I do not get a raise. I get my next level of certification on my own, no acknowledgment, no raise, no talk of promotion. I get demoted to the lowest level position (basic drafter) and a bunch of hiring ads go up for company for positions that I am qualified for that pay much better. Villain also gets promoted to regional director."

so here’s the details:

-there had always been contention between gm and i bc she’d get mad when i went past clock-out time to finish work that her ✨favorites✨ would leave behind. (i was part-time, so maybe once or twice in a year i would hit OT, so it wasn’t an issue with that)

-starting in 11/19, i started having pregnancy complications in my 2nd trimester, so i had three days in November i had to call out for (which i did have doctor’s notes for). started noticing a bit of tension, like my gm thought i was overreacting and like she wouldn’t take me seriously

-due to these complications (which i actually worked through for 10 days bc the first doctor told me i was fine), i was told by my doctor on 11/29 that i should not work until i had my son to try to keep him in as long as possible. i was on bed rest for about a week until i had him too prematurely, and i lost him.

-i told her i could come back to work two weeks after losing my son, and immediately i was picking up people’s shifts, training new employees, etc..

-i obviously was still recovering from my traumatic birth and loss, and i was also in the middle of helping my partner move an hour and a half away to get our apartment ready for when i was ready to move in with him. i had one call-out in March, and then one that was 3 weeks later in April.

-in between these, i also had bouts of GI symptoms that prohibited me from serving food, so obviously i got doctor’s notes and forwarded them, but otherwise worked my hours.

-finally, there was also her scheduling me on Good Friday knowing that i had a religious reason i couldn’t be there, and popped off on me in a text group with both of my shift leads when i told her i wouldn’t be able to work that day.

-when i called out that last time in April, she terminated me over “attendance,” when in reality, there were only 2 that were not covered by a doctor’s note. i had even told her i’d be able to work the next day and the day after without a problem.

5,2024-07-28,What should I do about my anxiety inducing gaslighting job/boss?,u/Rinku-Moon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eefcru/what_should_i_do_about_my_anxiety_inducing/,antiwork,"Just trying to get some opinions because honestly I just feel lost. I've been at my current job for nearly 10 years now. I started just working in the warehouse and slowly worked my way up in the company. The job initially was a retail store job, but throughout these 10 years I helped my boss build a thriving ecommerce business within the company. Just a year and a half ago, the retail store officially closed and my boss became the CEO and we kept the ecommerce company going. I've worn a million different hats in the company and did nearly everything (including recruiting). For a good year or so I was solely responsible for our marketing. This was when I was at my happiest. My job was hybrid with 2 days in and 3 days out and my main responsibility was marketing and sometimes recruiting. 

Then, last year around Christmas my family and I went through a horrifying event where someone broke into our house and threatened our lives with a knife. Thankfully none of us were injured and the suspect was caught, but we were very shaken from the whole event. Not long after we experienced this, my boss told me that he wanted to pivot what I do in the company. Rather than manage marketing, he wanted me to shift to managing all operations and working more directly with our warehouse lead. Another big change was that he wanted me to start coming into the office 4 times a week instead of 2. I tried to negotiate to 3 times a week, but he said his compromise was at 4.

My wife is a stay at home Mom and my daughter was just a little over 1 at the time. Because of what happened to my family, being away from my wife and daughter made me feel incredibly anxious, so losing most of my work from home capabilities felt awful. But, there wasn't much I could do. So the change in role became official. All of this with no increase in pay.

Fast forward a few months later and things have gotten so much worse. Two months ago we started doing in house manufacturing which now also falls under my purview to manage and figure out. Now I also am responsible for writing all sorts of work instructions and whatnot for ISO compliance. I haven't received any training for these new responsibilities because I'm a ""smart guy"" and will figure it out. Every Monday I have a meeting with the CEO and our warehouse lead where my boss basically spends a little over an hour gaslighting us and reaming us for being behind in outbound needs despite the fact that we workload is massive and we haven't hired anyone additional to help with it.

My CEO has said many times that he feels like he can't fulfill other duties he has because he's worried about operations. That being said, I spend most of my days planning out every hour of our fulfillment and manufacturing team to give him peace of mind and help us better meet our goals.

I cry most days from the stress of work and feel very defeated before the day even starts. With today being Sunday, the anxiety hit particularly hard as I get ready for another week of hell. 

I've talked with length to my boss about how in feeling only to be gaslight. I've tried involving HR and even though they disagree with my boss, he still won't budge. Last week he wanted to have a conversation about my role to hopefully help manage things better so I didn't feel the way I do.

That conversation ended up in him saying that he's been expecting to maintain all of my marketing responsibilities while taking on these new operations based responsibilities. Like what? 

I'm stressed. I'm tired. Depressed. And just done. Are all boses like this? Do I just need to toughen up and stick it out? Am I crazy?

I have been looking for a new job and have an interview for a potential new place to work, but there's 3 other interviews that I still need to do for that place so I'm not holding my breath.

20,2024-07-28,Don't dish if you can't accept,u/patchway247,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eefsny/dont_dish_if_you_cant_accept/,antiwork,"So, I'm still at the same job as the last post I've made. But things have gotten worse.

The manager, Asshat, that stepped up for me has now made things unimaginably worse without realizing it himself. Our female manager quit within 5 days of coming back from her vacation. I don't blame her as she worked her ass off, and when she came back things were 10x worse for her. Everyone's complaints about Asshat came flowing in. 

She found a better job. Well, better for herself. And I'm proud she could move forward from here.

I've yet to go back to being a server, and I'm tired of not being able to step away from the back when it is literally nothing to do. I was at the front helping with the host stand for a moment and head host came back and said ""Asshat said you're not allowed to leave the back and to get back there. He's watching cameras."" This mf-ers can't get off his ass when he's needed but can sure as hell get in everyone's way when he's not needed.

Last week I had about 6 tickets in my hand because Head Chef (HC) threw them all at once. I hate when he does it, but fuck it. Can't change it, so just try going with the flow. But when your servers come and try to get their own ticket while I'm pulling tickets in the time order they were punched in, suddenly I can't do my job. Get out of my way and this will be 3x faster. I understand you want your food out quickly, but you're throwing me and the kitchen off.

So when everyone *finally* cleared out HC asked how I was doing because his window was PACKED with plates. I said ""It feels like I'm drowning because people can't get out of my way for me to pull plates."" So he went and told Asshat. Asshat came out and asked what I needed help with. ""Nothing.""

He then proceeded to say I was lying and tried to grab all but the first ticket out of my hand. I finally let him and said ""it's hard to do my job when people are in my way. I can't grab plates, and I'm tired of being ignored."" He asked what he could do. ""To get out of my way and let me do my job"" I told him while trying to grab the tickets back.

""No. It's my job to *be* in your way."" 

I slapped the ticket down and said ""since it's your job to be in my way, then you can do my job. I'm not going to fight and have you pissed I can't get plates when you're in my way and won't move."" And walked to the second window he had opened up. Two sides is very difficult for one person to expo. 

I've told him before, and I'm tired of telling him. Tired of people getting pissed at me for wrong things getting grabbed when I wasn't even able to grab it. I've slowly stopped doing my job and literally being slow when I can be. Not going to run around like a chicken with my head cut off for people to be pissed at me.

Walked in today and was told he wasn't here. *THANK GOD*! I won't have that stress. Well, turns out he wasn't there *yet*. The moment he walked in the whole atmosphere dulled. Everyone tried working the best they could, but the more he kept getting into people's faces and in their way, the more the mood soured. 

All day window two would not put half their food out without me and whichever servers food it was getting onto him. Pancakes burnt or forgotten about for 5-10 minutes at a times when they should take 3 minutes tops. So while telling a server that ""I asked them 5 minutes ago where your pancakes were and they said they were down. I'm getting tired of him not doing his food."" And Asshat came up and said ""change your attitude or go home. I'm not going to let you ruin my day.""

I responded with ""so you can ruin mine, but heaven forbid I spur yours?"" And he turned right the fuck back around and asked what I meant. Told him boldface that when half your staff doesn't want to work with you, the other half calls out on days you're here and knowing damn well it's going to get chaotic from customers alone, and everyone gets more angry when you walk away from getting in their way, then it's you who needs to go the fuck home. Everyone was fine before you walked in, but when you did everyone's mood took a dive.

I really could not give a single fuck today. I'm about to get another job and was hoping it'd come thru in the middle of a rush, but it looks like it'll be done tomorrow at the latest. I really don't have time to sugar coat shit to my bosses anymore, and I don't really care anyone else's opinions on this right now. I'll hold back if I still need to be there or if it's a once in a while. But if it is every damn day, then you need to fuck off with your righteous bullshit you seem to ha e over everyone.

Oh, and yesterday he clocked me out before I was done working. He told me that I was cut, I placed my food, and continued to clean and work until my food was done. Today, as people were calling me left and right to help them *after* him saying not to ruin his day, he told me I was cut. But people were asking for help and needing follows and to restock shit. When I came back from helping take food out he asked if I was clocked out yet. ""Not yet, because I've been asked to help."" He told me to clock out, so I did. Dropped everything I was doing and went and clocked out.

Now listen here y'all, or for anyone who got this far, he still expected me to fucking work after I clocked out. Got pissed I put food back in the window I was about to walk out *to* go clock out. I will be contacting my states Department of Labor and Wages because he *still* hasn't changed my rate of pay. I'll be contacting them about him clocking me out early and not fixing my time (told me this morning he clocked me out the moment he told me I was cut). Not to mention I barely get 15 hours a week. Like you can't afford another 10 minutes of someone actually working but can afford a cook to stand around for an hour on the clock after telling him to go home.

Those people there really don't deserve him, they deserve someone better. If your manager is not making you an 'even' mood or in a better mood, it's not the place to be. If your manager actively makes you in a shittier mood and then gets pissed you're in a shitty mood, you don't need to be there. Either you need to leave or they do, and they sure as hell ain't going to leave easily. And I know I ain't going back if he's still there, so fuck it. Imma make a big ol' scene in a professional way and let everyone know you're a shit manager to work with. 

He doesn't understand that not everybody has the capability of just letting things go the second something happens. We can be aware that's what needs to happen, but actively doing so is not going to happen. I've explained in many ways and in different professional and unprofessional words. This man refuses to understand.

I won't give him notice I'm quitting, for 2 reasons. It's an at will state and the person who did put in their 2 weeks (today was their last day) he drastically cut their hours in half and gave them every shitty job that wasn't in their job description. 

He deserves half the staff to up and quit at once or just up and walk out. Night shift still doesn't do shit, and I'm tired of him being shitty towards day shift about forgetting to restock napkins but letting night shift get away with not cleaning food off tables and literal shit off the toilets. And I'm the puppet he so chooses to do that shit. Not anymore."

He’s disorganized af and I always get the blame for the consequences of his disorganization. 

How do I set boundaries around my time? Let’s say I’m scheduled until 3, and he says he’ll be there at 3, but then he says 3:30, and doesn’t show up until 5. If I have obligations after my shift, am I within my rights to clock out at my scheduled end time and lock the doors?

I'm currently a welder in a union manufacturing plant. Each day, we are very closely monitored on our individual performance. 

There is a big screen that displays everybody's daily production output in a percentage value, with 85% being the lowest acceptable productivity.

If you get below 85%, your name and stats are displayed in bright red at the bottom of the scoreboard, while better performers that day are displayed in green.

You are given anywhere from 8 minutes to 2 hours to fabricate and weld specific parts, but these times are incredibly difficult to meet unless you pad your time with ""Down Time"" and give a specific reason as to why you slowed down. 

Apparently this down time trick is the way most people keep their numbers up, but I've been discouraged against following the trend because I'm new, only been here for 4 months.
My legitimate reasons for putting down time on my daily time logs are being ignored, and my daily % sometimes dips below 85%.

If you're down too long, you risk getting a paper trail started. It begins with a verbal warning, then a write up. If you get 3 written warnings, you are fired for poor performance.

The union will not help us. Anyone who makes a fuss with the union gets fired. 

Anyone else dealt with this kind of thing in their workplace? I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub. I don't know where else to post this.

I ask this as a disabled person who is very willing to work, but is struggling because I can only do part time, low skilled stuff and those positions are all full in my city. Should someone like me have equal opportunity to get employment? I know anti discrimination laws exist, but let's be real here, employers can and have found loop holes and ways around them. 

I look around at my city where unemployment is fairly high right now and I see a LOT of disabled people. I also see a lot of substance abusers who if wanted to turn their lives around, would probably really struggle to find employment here, even of they got clean first. The few employment services they have here are extremely lacking and there's absolutely no programs that cater to disabled people specifically. 

But what do you think? If someone is willing to work, should they be able to easily get a job no matter their skills and abilities? Do you think jobs should be easier to get for disabled people? Should we be making more jobs that are suitable for those with specific needs? Should we have more placement programs that help those who have physical and/or cognitive disabilities?

They were formerly a district manager, but they were demoted. I have no idea if it was voluntary or involuntary. The point is: they’re a respected veteran within the company, and they’re well connected.  
  
I used to like our GM. But it has become evident to me that they abuse the managers, shirk their responsibilities, and squander our budget.  
We have no leads. We just lost our key holder. The AGM and CM are desperate to get out, but they both *care* about the store and believe in how great it could be. They’re both at the end of their rope but they don’t want to abandon the rest of the staff.  
If we could band together and take a stand against our GM, we would. But ever since something like that happened at another location and that GM was let go, our DM has threatened to dismiss the entire team to protect GMs.  
  
We don’t know what to do, so here’s a list of the transgressions that I am aware of (in no particular order).  
If you have any ideas, however radical, please share:  
  
- Unless they’re opening the store, they arrive late. Unless they’re closing the store, they leave early.  
- Last year, the AGM went on vacation for 2 weeks, but they didn’t have any PTO left. At that time, our GM still liked the AGM because the AGM (who held down the fort after the last GM left) was still doing more than their fair share of work. GM assured AGM that they would “take care of it.” Their solution? To schedule AGM as usual and clock them in and out at the appropriate times. The DM was notified. The situation was resolved by allotting AGM more PTO. Nothing else came of it.  
- In January, they promoted a lead to CM despite knowing that said lead would be leaving around August. Come February, they hired someone to take over as CM, promising each candidate individually that the other would be demoted to key holder. Against company policy, we had two CMs until June. The one who was demoted was never informed that their job title had changed. They were under the impression that they were still CM until shortly before they left because they were still being paid the same rate.  
- They have a tendency of not notifying staff that they’ve been fired. They simply stop scheduling them and ignore  the former staff’s attempts to reach out. The last time this happened, the former staff member had to ambush them at the store just to get an explanation.  
- Against company policy, they’ve promoted minors to managerial positions on two separate occasions.  
- They also cussed out one of those minors in front of AGM. The minor, with the support of AGM, did file a report. No disciplinary action was taken.  
- They treat poc staff (particularly black and Hispanic people) with a degree of hostility that they don’t direct towards their white staff. They‘ve also made blatantly racist remarks about poc associates. No disciplinary action was taken. We currently do not employ any black or Hispanic people.  
- Towards the end of the last quarter, hours were getting cut because we’d overshot our budget. The subordinate staff was assured that their hours would return to normal come the start of the next quarter and the summer season. This was true, for about 2 weeks. GM was tasked with hiring 3 seasonal employees. They hired 9. When questioned, they confessed that they intended to resolve the issue by “allocating hours based on performance metrics.” Last I heard, we were $400 over budget. For the last 3 weeks, 6+ hour shifts have been scarce for everyone aside from managers.  
- They have forbidden an associate from using disability aids while out on the floor.  
- Among other things, they bought a coffee maker (never used), a blender (rarely used), and two vacuums with the store supplies budget. They’ve expressed an interest in wanting to buy a $300 grill for the breakroom, as well. For burgers and hotdogs. That they also want to buy on store dollar. The DM found out and reprimanded AGM and CM for “allowing” the misuse of funds.

961,2024-07-29,got reprimanded for not picking up an unexpected shift at the last minute,u/Beautiful_Set1888,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eetm8y/got_reprimanded_for_not_picking_up_an_unexpected/,antiwork,"Hey i dont really post here but i thought you guys might find this funny/depressing and i want to vent a little before bed. I was at work today and I got called into a 40 minute HR meeting because I didn't take a shift that a co-worker didn't show up for.

I was at work 2 Saturdays ago and at the end of a 6-hour shift my coworker who was meant to come relieve me didn't show up. Nobody's really around on weekends, I won't say where I work but I'm the only one in the department and if it isn't staffed by somebody with my level of qualifications the whole department needs to shut down. Shutting down is an expensive procedure as it loses us a lot of business and results in a lot of complaints from the public, so obviously management doesn't like when we close for any reason.

Anyways, the guy who was scheduled to come in just didn't show. Me and the only other person working in the building that day both tried to contact him via phone but he wasn't picking up. Couldn't contact my manager because she was on vacation, and the interim manager didn't pick up the phone or respond to texts. I waited 40 minutes for a response from anyone but did not get one, so I cleared the department and closed up. Then I sent another text to the interim manager telling her I closed up because this guy didn't show up. 2 hours later I get the ""Ok"" text from my manager. They didn't bring the issue up all week even though I was around and the actual manager was back from vacation. But today I got called into HR in an emergency meeting so they could inquire about the issue.

At first I didn't even realize they were implying that I had done something wrong, I figured the meeting was just to confirm that this person didn't show up for their shift and they had to get some sort of official statement from me for whatever reason. First they asked ""Why didn't you take X's shift"" to which I replied ""I had to get home"", to which they answered ""Why?"" which was the point where I just kinda sat and stared for like 30 seconds because I was so confused. Eventually I snapped out of it and asked why it mattered since it wasn't my shift and they immediately retorted with ""Once X didn't show up the shift became your responsibility, I'm just wondering why you chose to close the building rather than stay and pick up the shift."" Again, leaving me speechless. 

The tone of the meeting at this point was getting aggressive to the point where I knew I was somehow the one getting in trouble for this. I considered lying about some appointment or something but in the end I just gave the honest answer ""Yeah I was just tired and wanted to go home, it's not my responsibility to work shifts that aren't assigned to me, I need to be given notice."" They rattled off a few things, at this point they sounded almost like they were reading from a pre-written script. I distinctly remember them saying ""You know we would have paid you for the shift, right?"" and trying to suppress laughter at the idea that I might work an unscheduled double-shift for no pay. Another gem was ""We have an expectation that employees take initiative in situations like these and we didn't see that in you that day.""

Honestly I just sat there and took it, I'm stunned and a little confused. Mostly now I just find it funny if not a little frustrating. They made me sign some official reprimand and put it in my file. I'd understand if I was like responsible for a nuclear power plant and my leaving caused a city-wide blackout or something but literally all that happened is the business lost a little money and some people didn't get to buy stuff from us. This is a part-time minimum wage job I'm not going to pick up an unplanned double shift with no overtime pay, am I unreasonable in thinking these people are insane for just expecting that?"

24,2024-07-29,Got a lecture at work ,u/cynical_mundane,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eetvxk/got_a_lecture_at_work/,antiwork,"I work in mid sized agency and due to the nature of the job, pull a lot of late nights due to unrealistic deadlines and shitty clients. 

Because of the late nights, I have been coming in late to work these past few weeks (it's office policy to allow employees to come late if they've left after a certain time). Now, last Thursday, I got pretty late because I'd left the office at almost 12 the night prior and reached home at 1and reached the office around noon. 

I got called in a meeting with a few of my seniors and they asked if I had any ideas for a new project. I had been told to think of something but got no time because the job which I had to stay late for took so much of my energy. When I told them this they started to say how they've noticed how I am late pretty often, told me to sharpen my time management skills, basically asked me to come on time in the morning even when I leave late. They tried to spin it as a ""we're just looking out for you"" kinda spiel. 

My raise is still pending when the performance evaluations were 3 months ago and the senior management are just keeping us hanging. I've accepted that the raise isn't coming and am already looking for a replacement job but the whole lecture made me feel even more undermined and resentful. Here I am working 10 times more than my shitty paycheck already (I am being paid 15 percent less than the industry average but managing a portfolio of 10+ clients) only to be patronised. It sucked even more because I used to hang outside of work with those seniors and used to be pretty chatty with them, now I just don't see them in that light anymore. I guess it's a lesson that you shouldn't be friends with your higher ups. "

I'm working my usual saturday shift, and a coworker comes in with a big smile on his face. He (M19) tells us that his girlfriend (F17) is pregnant. Now, he's the only guy working that day amongst a bunch of ladies, so we are all have a giggle telling him alllllll about parenthood. He was stressed out, but excited (he had a whole app to track the baby's growth and was proudly showing us, awww!😭) and our AGM was very welcoming to his girlfriend and has almost become an auntie to my coworker. We'll call him James from now on.

So, saturday ends and sunday I'm back to work. James comes in, but he is nothing like he was yesterday and I can tell something is wrong. I ask, and he tells me that his girlfriend has been saying she's in pain, to such a degree that she feels like she needs to go to a hospital. I hear this and ask why he's here and, of course, its because of our new GM. She's a very cold woman. Takes away employee's hours for pissing her off, fires people on a whim, scream when anything (ANYTHING) changes the people SHE put on the schedule, ect. James was afraid to call out with less than 2 hours before his shift because he was afraid he wouldn't have a job afterwards.

This sounds serious, or at least like something that should be checked immediately. James really needs to go, like now. I tell as much to the manager working, who goes and calls our GM. Big mistake. She throws a fit that the scheduale is being changed and the spiteful, petty decision is made that James will be forced to stay.

Heres the kicker. Another coworker I worked with yesterday is a dear friend, so I had walked her and her daughter to her car when their shift was over. Let's call her Evette. Evette tells me to let her know if someone calls out ON SUNDAY because she would like to replace them to get more hours for extra rent money. As an aside, all the adults reading this understand that James's girlfriend should have told her parents so that they could assist her with this medical emergancy. We all know that. The fact is, she hadn't, but she's also in the middle of possibly losing that baby and SOMEONE needs to be the adult and facilitate her getting the help she needs.

The shift goes how you would expect. James is stressing the whole time, and his girlfriend is, of course, terrified. James was scheduled to leave at 3 and, at 2ish, his girlfriend told him she was bleeding. They finally let him leave at 2:30. Oh, SO gracious of them, right? 

As of right now, I dont have any updates about that poor girl, unfortunately. Just a lot of anger and frustration. The GM literally had the perfect situation lined up, with Evette already offering to come in the day before. There's literally no other reason you would MAKE that boy stay throughout his girlfriends medical emergancy unless you were just being petty and spiteful. No, its not technically our problem. Yes, she should have told her parents. But where is your compasaion for the situation these kids have gotten themselves into? What about for that poor girl, sitting there absolutely terrified with no one there for her other than James, who can only be there via call? She may have been actively misscarrying and you won't do the EASIEST employee switch we've ever had? For what? Because you're mad?

That woman (the GM) must have no heart. Before her, the AGM was the GM and we all tried our best to do well by her because we all felt that base level of compassion she had for all her employees. If this had happened back then? The AGM would have been looking for a replacement immediately and, if none was found, the rest of us would've taken up the extra work gladly so that he could take her to the hospital. Because most of the employees have that compasaion for each other. 

This new GM comes in wanting to be intimidaing, cold, gives none of us a way to contact her but gets upset when people call the AGM, takes away hours from people who piss her off (which could be something as little as telling her they can't work a day thats a whole week away), full on crossed people off the schedule for pissing her off, constantly screams at everyone that we MUST be first place, has stated that she throws cups when she's mad, and gets unreasonably upset when our timer isn't below 110 seconds....even though the target is 180 seconds and we are usually well below that.

I dunno, I'm just upset at the lack of compassion and needed to vent."

I’ve been reflecting on the role work plays in our lives and how it shapes our society. It’s becoming increasingly clear that our current approach to work is outdated and unsustainable. Here’s why I think it’s time we start reimagining what work means to us:

1. **Burnout and Mental Health:** The relentless grind of 9-to-5 jobs and the pressure to always be “on” are taking a severe toll on our mental health. Burnout is now a common experience, and it's clear that our current work culture isn’t designed with well-being in mind.
2. **The Work-Life Balance Myth:** Many of us are striving for a work-life balance that seems perpetually out of reach. The reality is that the boundaries between work and personal life are increasingly blurred, leading to stress and dissatisfaction.
3. **Automation and AI:** As technology advances, many jobs are becoming obsolete or are being automated. Instead of clinging to traditional work structures, we should explore new ways to ensure that everyone benefits from these advancements, without being tied to outdated job models.
4. **Redefining Success:** Our societal definition of success is often tied to career achievements and financial gains. But success should be about fulfillment and happiness, which can come from various sources beyond traditional employment.
5. **Alternative Models:** There are already examples of alternative work models, such as universal basic income, job sharing, and more flexible work arrangements. These models offer promising ways to rethink our approach to work and ensure that everyone can lead fulfilling lives without being tethered to a conventional job.

It’s time to start a broader conversation about how we can build a future where work is not just a means to survive but a part of a more balanced and equitable life. What are your thoughts on reimagining work? How can we move towards a system that truly supports well-being and fulfillment?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

Thank you to everyone who helped me build up the courage to quit. I ended up sending an email to the district manager of my branch, and to my boss herself on Sunday. I explained in the email that I cannot work my last week because I have recently tested positive for the flu (I seriously have and i’m dying lol). She texted me this morning asking me if I would be able to work until 2 today. I texted her back letting her know that I have the flu and that I have also sent her an email. She said “this is the first I’m hearing of this. Please send a text next time.”

This is making me think that she still has yet to read my email. So my follow up question would be, do I just leave it and have her see the email, or do I also text my resignation to her because she might be thinking that i’m working on Wednesday now….

I feel like I know the answer, but I have such severe anxiety I have a hard time realizing that I’m not the one wrong in this situation…. I’ll attach the email I sent below for reference! I took out the company name just to keep my anonymity 🫡

Hello,
I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position of Assistant Manager effective immediately. My last day would be 7/27. I was planning to finish out my last week, however due to medical issues (I have tested positive for the flu and am incredibly ill), I will be unable to. While this may be unexpected, I am grateful for the opportunities that this company has provided me. This was a difficult choice to make, but there are circumstances that are preventing me from continuing to work for *insert company name* as a company. I wish everyone the best, and have left my keys in my drawer."

During my freelance contract they gave us the ultimatum to go full time or have our contract end. So I chose the full time route. 

They since have reorganized the entire work load and expectations. Eliminating my current job of 2 years to hire freelancers to do it for less, to increase profit margins.  So it's gone full circle from being freelance, to full time, to being replaced by freelancers. 😂

They said I could quit or be terminated August 23rd. I obviously told them to term me.

Since this is an issue with them outsourcing my work, I'm hoping I'll be eligible for Unemployment until I can get my resume out to places. I'm obviously starting now, but not particularly confident I'll find something comparable in less than a month. 

But my manager is saying I'll be termed because I'm not meeting expectations on the work scope. Work scope being grammar and punctuation. I wasn't hired to do that. I was hired as a Legal Formatter. Adding examination, exhibits, parentheticals, etc to legal documents. That job still exists, but is outsourced work now. They gave me 3 testing documents for Legal Transcription and decided I no longer belong with the company due to grammar and punctuation errors.

Any thoughts or advice on proper things to document and do to get unemployment, would greatly be appreciated. First time being fired. "

I find myself doing more work because otherwise it might not be done, or is done in a way that creates more work/need to correct mistakes.

The numbers do reflect that I am doing more and it’s not really an issue for me- I don’t feel like I’m spreading myself too thin at all.

However, my very absent and disorganized manager finally noticed this, called me out in a meeting, and wants to work with me this week to coach me on my “time management skills.” Am I wrong for feeling slightly annoyed that this is being presented as a failure on my part? Am I also wrong to think that being coached on “time management” skills implies that you are not managing your time effectively, i.e, not getting your work done? I could be looking at this from the wrong angle.

Maybe I still need to get used to working for the state, but I’ve never been chastised for
working too hard before. Especially when the work is fairly straightforward. How would you approach this? Thank you so much!"

I know it's just a pipe dream especially here in the US we're both parties are corrupt as hell but one can hope . Overall it just seems like a serious race to the bottom and eventually it will get to a point where it doesn't matter how cheaply things are manufactured people still can't afford it.

Every day, someone calls in and talks to me horribly. They blame me for things out of my control, yell at me, call me names, etc. I’ve learned to adapt to this because I understand that they are angry at the company, not necessarily me. 

Well today, a man came in and requested to do something that we can’t help him with here. I apologized for the inconvenience and wrote down the phone number of the department that can help. He lost his mind about it and the conversation ended with him calling me fat. 

Sounds like such a stupid thing to get upset about, but I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t know why people have become so horrible. I have two family members with advanced cancer — I just found out last week that one of them is inoperable and has 6 months as her prognosis. I’m extra sensitive right now and I can’t handle this shit anymore. I know I’m bigger, I’m more than well aware because I live in this body.

The next thing is a doozy and I’m here to ask if it’s illegal. This man expects his employees to pay other employees out of their own paychecks when shifts are covered. For example my partner worked an hour of someone else’s shift with no pay to reflect that on their stub.

24,2024-07-29,Share of Workers paid less than a Living Wage,u/meothfulmode,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1efcey0/share_of_workers_paid_less_than_a_living_wage/,antiwork,"Inspired by u/twotimefind's post I went and used my free time (been out of work since October, 2023) and spreadsheet skills to figure out how many workers don't get paid a Living Wage.  
  
[According to the MIT Living wage project:](https://livingwage.mit.edu/pages/methodology)

>At its simplest, a **living wage** is what one full-time worker must earn on an hourly basis to help cover the cost of their family’s minimum basic needs where they live while still being self-sufficient.

This seems, to me, the only useful metric for judging whether a job pays you enough. In order to be free to pursue your own path you need to be financially independent.

Well, turns out it's a lot of us. Too many by far. [Source to google sheet to check my work.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zSCcg8VbJ-VF2jPUyyv174IFj0UK9ZMGUzdUKU1hr8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

[Graph of &#37; workers living below the living wage line by state, combo'd with &#37; representation by unions.](https://preview.redd.it/vdb85rwm6jfd1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=35fad7517da7c9e4c395fd2691f9b9177a55594d)

1. The average % of workers who do not get paid a living wage in their state is 39.73%\[1\]
   * Excluding DC the average % of workers below the living wage line for their state is 40.16%\[2\].
   * The state with the most workers below the living wage line is Mississippi at 53%
2. The best 5 states to live in to get a chance at a living wage or above are
   1. California - 25%
   2. North Dakota - 26%
   3. New York - 28%
   4. Minnesota - 31%
   5. Wisconsin - 33%

  
**I went a bit further to see if Unions played a role in the difference between states and it turns out that yes, it seems to, but the effect is small in their current form.** My guess is this has more to do with the relative strength of unions as a whole rather than the ineffectiveness of unions as a concept. I would find it interesting to see this broken down by occupation, and whether unions with more striking power are more effective. **If someone wants to hire me to do this work I'm available.**

All in all this is a good reminder that while Americans get paid very well on average compared to the rest of the world, the number that matters more is how much you need to live comfortable. Especially as corporations try to crack down on remote work arbitrage it's important to advocate for better wages across the board. You can do this through the following methods:

* **Refuse to take jobs that pay less than a living wage (if we all do this eventually they have to pay more)**
* **Join a union and participate (the trend line IS there, and more militant unions will be more effective)**
* **Refuse to engage in services that charge too much if you can \[3\]**

  
**Footnotes**

* \[1\] I used the data for 1 worker 0 kids, because it includes the most people. We all know it's a bit easier to pay rent if you live with someone, but not all of us have intimate partners and that shouldn't be a requirement for survival
*  \[2\] DC is a weird outlier in that it's % of workers not paid a living wage is 6% below the next lowest. I assume this has to do with the size of DC relative to highly paid workers in the government and lobbying, but I don't know enough and I'm not being paid to go figure it out.
* \[3\] I don't have the data breaking down what costs the most in each area, but as much as you can refuse to pay high prices for shit that's being price gouged. Capitalist won't lower prices unless they're forced to."

Have been doing my job amazingly, getting compliments from clients/higher ups/basically everyone. I dont particaularly like the work, but apparently im good at it and it pays the bills, so whatever. At the same time, there was a small ""internal"" project that was starting up that I threw my name in to help develop. Over the course of a few months, its been growing, and I find myself absolutely loving it. The (now a much larger) project is engaging, useful, and most importantly of all, something I actually like doing and am passionate about, and I felt like I was actually personally ""growing"" in the role

 All of my other normal, ""day to day"" work had been balanced along with it, and I was effectively able to do them both.

  
Until this week. After weeks of ""discussion"" (none with me) it was decided that my time would be best spent back 100% on my stupid ""day to day"" role, with no time reserved at all for the ""side"" project. I was finally starting to feel like I was growing into a role I could actually see myself liking as a career, and its suddenly all gone.

  
Its just another lesson for myself I suppose, to never believe a company will care about your personal growth. "

(With page number and links) ",u/Grandmaster_Autistic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1efhx54/direct_quotes_from_the_heritage_foundation/,antiwork,"Here are some quotes from the document ""2025 Mandate for Leadership"" 

1. **Quote:** ""Historically, unions were thought to be incompatible with government management. There is a natural limit to the bargaining power of private-sector unions, but the financial bottom line of public-sector unions is not similarly constrained. If private-sector unions push too hard a bargain, they can so harm a company or so reduce efficiency that their employer is forced to go out of business and eliminate union jobs altogether. There is no such limit in government, which cannot go out of business, so demands can be excessive without negatively affecting employee and union bottom lines.""  
   **Page:** 81  
   **Explanation:** This statement suggests that public-sector unions can make excessive demands without worrying about the consequences, unlike private-sector unions where companies could go out of business. This can be seen as a criticism of public-sector unions, implying they can act irresponsibly without financial repercussions.

2. **Quote:** ""Even Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt considered union representation in the federal government to be incompatible with democracy. Striking and even threats of bargaining and delay were considered acts against the people and thus improper.""  
   **Page:** 81  
   **Explanation:** This quote points out that historically, even leaders like Franklin Roosevelt believed that unions in the government could disrupt democratic processes. It implies that union actions could be against public interest, which might upset union supporters who see such actions as defending workers' rights.

3. **Quote:** ""The Davis–Bacon Act redistributes wealth from hardworking Americans to those that benefit from government-funded construction projects. Repealing the Davis–Bacon Act would increase worker freedom and end a longstanding effective tax on American families.""  
   **Page:** 604  
   **Explanation:** This passage criticizes the Davis-Bacon Act, suggesting it unfairly benefits certain workers at the expense of taxpayers. Repealing it could be seen as taking away protections that ensure fair wages on public projects, which would concern unions that support such regulations.

4. **Quote:** ""Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) are short-term collective bargaining agreements that apply to construction projects. There are a few reasons that construction projects may benefit from a PLA, and there are many reasons that even when actively encouraged to do so public construction projects have declined to use PLAs. Among the consequences: The majority of construction firms and construction workers are not unionized and their temporary forced unionization results in large-scale wage theft; construction companies are significantly less likely to bid on projects with PLAs; and PLAs consistently drive up construction costs by 10 percent to 30 percent.""  
   **Page:** 604  
   **Explanation:** This statement criticizes PLAs, arguing that they force non-union workers into unions temporarily, which is described as wage theft. It also claims that PLAs increase project costs, which could anger unions who support these agreements for protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair wages.

5. **Quote:** ""Congress should also consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate in the first place. The bipartisan consensus up until the middle of the 20th century held that these unions were not compatible with constitutional government. After more than half a century of experience with public-sector union frustrations of good government management, it is hard to avoid reaching the same conclusion.""  
   **Page:** 82  
   **Explanation:** This quote questions the appropriateness of public-sector unions, suggesting they may not be compatible with good governance. It implies that public-sector unions cause inefficiencies in government management, which could upset union members who believe in the importance of these unions for protecting public employees' rights.

I'm 19 and this woman was around her late 30s to 40s. She was with her husband and they both said/did some pretty inappropriate things. She basically gave me a 5-7 minute lecture on how I need to be more assertive while rubbing my chest while her husband was talking about my nipples. She was about 6 inches from my face too and the smell of alcohol was pretty strong so I'm positive she was over served. I'll be honest I'm a little upset my coworkers didnt do more to stop it but one of them did call the shift lead that was there. He didnt mention that this woman was touching me so ofc the shift lead didnt get there before it stopped. The shift lead came up to me after I had already walked away and asked what was up and I told him this woman was rubbing my chest and after hearing that he didnt bother to even ask who she was or any other important info.



I asked the same shift lead for an updated the next day to see if anyone spoke with this woman before she left and he said to his knowledge no one had. He told me he would tell the main manager about my report and I believed he would because why wouldnt he? Well he didnt and a week and a half later I ask one of the two managers for an update about the report I made and he hadnt heard anything about it. Later that day I was able to get in touch with the main manager and she was really apologetic but again.... nothing else was really done about it. She told me she was going to let the staff know what happened and I think re train them but over a week later I was talking to some of the waiters about what happened and they didnt seem to know anything about what happened, so I'm assuming she didnt retrain the staff or tell them one of the staff had been assaulted at work like she said she would.



Oh and another thing a little unrelated to the story but another reason why I quit, they had me working from 10:30am - 5pm sometimes 6pm without a break for food or rest. I'm a busser so I mostly get paid through tips and so I cant leave until my tables leave. Technically my shift ends at 3pm but I have to stay for any tables that are seated before 3pm. They would also regulalry schedule half of their workers for double shifts, doubles are the only time you get a break. I live in North Carolina so to my knowledge it is totally legal to not give your workers a break."

I work at auto zone & I had just finished doing the trash & as soon as I finished the manager says “clock out, go home” I respond “I think I’d like to stay and finish my shift which ends at 10, I don’t see a reason why I can’t stay these last 30 minutes” to which he responds “clock out go home, we don’t need you there is no customers” keep in mind it is the manager, me & 2 other red shirt employees. He is only targeting me and says nothing to the other two who are scheduled for more hours than I am for the week so this seems unfair & not right. I decline & say I am scheduled till 10, I will stay till 10. Once he realizes I have no interest in clocking out for until closing he then out of pettiness says “okay go stock these shelves”. Remember there are two others standing there not doing anything but he tells ME only to go and stock shelves 10 minutes before closing after I had finished doing what he had already told me to do. I kindly responded, I would rather get fired than do as you are instructing me in such a childish manner. Because of that response he calls the store manager and tells him the situation to which the store manager says, do what he tells you and we’ll talk about it tomorrow. I stocked the shelves and clocked out immediately after finishing. What do you think of this situation? "

I’ve given my blood, sweat, and tears to the place. It is a very very intense place to work with an insane workload seasonally. During a time of intense turnover last year (I am part of a very small team, 3 of the 5 people on my team quit at once because they were so burnt out) I not only helped onboard and train the new folks (it takes literally months to be trained in my job) but took on most of the workload of my departed coworkers during a busy, busy time. I sucked it up because it provided me with more bonus potential and I wound up making about 15% of my base salary in bonuses last year. I wound up being the highest earner on my team. 

My boss was canned due to the turnover and I applied for his job, and they chose an external candidate over me. I’ll call her Karen. Karen is the most heartless and petty person I’ve ever worked for. She has specifically targeted me for applying for her job in the past, belittles me in front of the team, and overall has targeted me. My former bonus structure was stripped away and replaced with something that they’re refusing to sign. My job, despite being a pretty successful (or so I thought) company with multiple markets, does not have an HR so I reached out to the CEO and he claimed to have my back. About a week later, I noticed my position was posted on a job board for $15K less than my base salary (I make slightly more of a base salary than other team members due to my seniority) and Karen was secretly having job interviews. Turns out, there’s some severe cash flow issues I wasn’t privy to. Three days later, I was placed on a 30 day PIP that had some, frankly, humiliating requirements (such as reading a self help book and presenting it to the rest of the team to prove I’m applying it to my life). Other metrics are simply impossible for me to hit given they’re relative to Karen’s opinion, so she’s nit picking me and setting me up to fail. 

I don’t have a job lined up, but a former employer told me I could go back at any time and just take a huge pay cut so I kind of do? I was planning on putting my two weeks tomorrow. I have a month’s worth or PTO they legally have to pay me and two more paychecks if I go this route. However, today, I was told by Karen, my CEO, and another member of leadership to do something illegal. It isn’t a serious offense, but enough where it could potentially harm me professionally if it gets noticed. I have refused and have yet to get a response.

So, regardless, I am going to be either terminated, have my notice put in, or made to leave without letting me finishing my notice. Regardless, I’m grateful to be out of this hellhole. And no matter what, because my workload is the heaviest in my department, they will be completely fucked over regardless and won’t know what to do with my insane list of projects with fast approaching deadlines. Good riddance. "
6,2024-07-30,Friday drinks or work,u/Kruimelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1efmln5/friday_drinks_or_work/,antiwork,"Last Friday, the company I work for got an email from an out of touch manager.

Every Friday the company hosts a Friday-afternoon-drinks session (very common in The Netherlands). It starts around 4 and ends when people want to go home.

The manager sent out an email stating:
""We all enjoy the Friday drinks. It's a social event and we love seeing so many people join. However, some people choose to not go to these events. We understand nog everyone wants to get drinks and socialize. If you are one of these latter people, please understand we do expect you to work the full 8,5 hours.""

So basically, join the boss for drinks, and get forced to socialize, or do more work while a bunch of socialites are out drinking on company time. "

6,2024-07-30,What's some shit people say that you just wish would shut up about (Ranting a little and tired),u/TheDesertFoxIrwin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1efmy7q/whats_some_shit_people_say_that_you_just_wish/,antiwork,"Mine is the constant anti-homeless rhetoric 

If you look down on stealing, that's fine, and I do get annoyed when shoplifters try to act like they're pulling off some heist just to get a few things (seriously, just walk out, it's just a grocery store, not Fort Knox).

But holy shit, so many people (especially white liberal-leaning) are insufferable because they're either act completely antipathic or narcistic.

""It's a good thing, there won't be theft.""

""that'll teach them.""

""Unlike them, I pay""

Why are you so concerned? Do you own a stake in the comopany? No? then what's your angle?

I've had co-workers look down on them, even after how badly the manager has treated us. One of them (who I thought was pretty left-leaning) went on to villainize people stealing food as ""druggies stealing to sell it for drug money.""

Just shut up. It's gotten worse when we got security guards (as in, just guys who stand there and scare people, not actually armed guards), because now people won't shut up. Yeah, thanks for telling me (someone who works here a lot) that we have security.

Meanwhile, they call them police (which a woman got mad at me for correcting her, because to here ""whatever-badge=police/cops"".

Meanwhile there's this weird quasi-military ""thank you for your service"" respect for them. I was literally told by a customer ""thanks your managers for getting security"". Then they have long conversation with security guards (which totally doesn't distract them from their job you respect).

  
What funny is how uncomfortable it feels and how useless they feel.

During a night shift, we had this lady who they suspected was stealing (which was a soda). As she was paying, they decided to surround me and her, because she was in my station. I was just thinking ""Hey, dumbasses, stay in your regions by the doors, this is my responsibility, to serve this woman.""

Another time, one of they tried to apprehend a woman stealing a bottle of Pepsi. He grabbed her arm and I just thought about the shit show if that guy broke her arm (old ladies are always that tough).

Then we get to their uselessness.

So one of my coworkers felt uncomfortable leaving to her car because there was troublesome vagrant she had in her path. They're debating what to do...while a security guard is within hearing distance. I was busy going ""I thought this is why we had them, ask them."" or ""Hey, dude, you clearly hear my co-worker is trying to leave, do your job and escort her."".

  
Then after that whole ""thank your managers"" comment, a customer reports a guy is stealing beer (turns out it was a bottle of powerade). She asks where the security guards are. Turns out one of them left a hour into their shift and the remaining one disappeared. She wanted me to call them, but, fun fact, they don't have radios. And I know I shouldn't say anything on the overhead. So she deicdes to keep an eye on this guy (keep in mind, she's done shopping). When a guard finally comes, he than talks to me like I need to do something. I just go ""what? you're security, this isn't my job."".

  
Also, the guards are only here after 1. So before that, shoplifters can just be here before that. Which defeats the purpose of having security.

And meanwhile I'm told to feel safe? Dude, they've proven to just made the situation more heated and less friendly then it needs to be and utterly useless at their jobs, and we're paying they for probably the same amount stolen thief (money we can make up for in 10 minutes via sales), while our work force is a total crap shot.

I felt safe before. I pedal my bike at night thought this place. It's mostly fine.. You leave in a middle-higher class neighborhood so I don't know what your problem other then finding a person to beat up on to feel superior."

Now, I'm just not at a stage in my life right now where i want to work full time.

So my question is, how can I navigate this situation without accidentally getting the job?haha. Do I need to do the application, and attend the interview if necessary, and somehow finagle it so that I'm not a competitive candidate? How would I even do that? Or is there some other way I can dodge the requriement? Is it time to start looking for some medical excuse to get these job providers off my case?

When he showed up, I was surprised and immediately concerned. He was promoted (over me) about a month and a half ago. I never even heard of the guy, nor knew a promotion was available, and met him shortly after. He’s a solid dude, and from that moment on I was rooting for him and I let him know that. He was genuine and appreciative. 

Fast forward to yesterday and the guy tells me he’s leaving for Texas - for good. He’s living out of his truck, with his wife, and because he is required to drive so much with the promotion, the costs have been piling up. The company we work for is just now paying for the tolls, he still hasn’t received his gas card, and it basically ran his savings dry. 

He cherry-picked me as a replacement, but come to find out I make more than him as an hourly employee versus his salary. 

My heart goes out to the guy. Crazy to think I was bitter about his promotion but it turns out he not only needed the break, but it was the outcome that broke him. 

Count your blessings, and be grateful."

902,2024-07-30,Company Bought a Corporate Jet Recently - Salary Increases are Capped at 2% This Year,u/trippingmonkeyballs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1efvrvt/company_bought_a_corporate_jet_recently_salary/,antiwork,"
US inflation was 6.5% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023, BTW.  The company I work for capped increases at 2% and purchased a corporate jet for executive leadership this year.

I had my review last month and was told by the CFO I should consider myself fortunate to get a 3.7% raise, since he capped increases at 2%.  I requested a salary review, because my title and pay do not match my responsibilities, which keep increasing.  

There are times I do the jobs of at 2 or more people.  I am knowledgeable, work very efficiently and independently - I am told to do something once and if I don’t know how to do it, I learn how. The CFO admitted to increasing my responsibilities as a way to “challenge” and “engage” me - to develop my career.  An example of added responsibility is IT project planning and controlling IT costs (and he praises my abilities and successes).

I am waiting on HR to gather market appropriate wage information for a salary review.  I find out this morning the company president recently purchased a corporate jet for executive leadership (VP & senior director level use).  

I mean.  I am surprised, but not surprised.  It is a clear message they think they are better than us.  After my raise I net an additional $75 per pay check (or $150 per month), and I am told I am one of the”fortunate” ones.   What’s the point in being “challenged” and “engaged” when those at the top keep exploiting and taking from those of us in the middle and on the bottom?”.

A friend of mine (34 M) owns a food truck and does gigs around the mid western USA. So far he has serviced 3 Amazon locations and has decided to boycott them because only 5 people total have come out and bought something from him on 3 separate trips to different warehouses. He couldn't wrap his head around why either. 

I told him that they usually make the workers pay for the food onsite and more likely than not can only utilize it during their extremely short brakes, so it isn't likely he would be getting a lot of attention there.

After I told him that he decided to never accept an offer from Amazon. He told me this morning that they reached out to him again and asked if he would. He said no and explained to them why. A few hours later he gets an email back saying that they are willing to pay him cover to make up for the loss of profits. Amazon is so wonderful that'd they give a hard working food truck owner $50 for 4 hours of work to sit there and do nothing knowing no one can afford to or has time to use his services. 

I don't really understand why people hate on billionaires and execs so much. They take the money from us and steal so it won't weigh us down so much! You silly geese it makes life easier to have less duhhhhhh."

My new manager asked me to do an urgent data entry task for one of my collages (who is from other department) on tracking his projects.

After I sit down with my collage, got an understanding of the scope and noticed this is a very low value and very time-consuming task, comparing to my current projects. 
Due to my current workload, I’m really on the bandwidth of can not taking additional tasks without impact my performance negatively. So I decide to reach out to my manager to discuss about priority, then my manager said directly to me “He(that co-worker) doesn't have time to do it, someone has to do it, we think you are the best fit. You should drop everything on your hand right now and prioritize this task.”  
So that I asked him to help me understand the importance / value I can bring to and gain from this task. But my manager told me “sometimes you have to do things adding no value to yourself, if you want to success in your career, you also need to be flexible enough and help each other.” I explained that I understand both teams are very under resources, I'm busy too. I expressed the reason I work here is that I want to be not only being helpful, but also impactful. I prefer to delicate my time to the projects making more impact to long term. He told me “stop complaining, you are wasting your time here, just do the task”

First of all, I feel like my manager is not respecting my time and my standing at all, and I don't understand why other people's time is more precious than mine（especially consider this is out of my scope of work)

Second, somehow I feel my manager is trying to gaslight me.. He keeps saying he wants to help me on becoming a better team player, and think in big picture. But based on my most current performance review, all the 360 degree feedback from my teammates and collages from other team are saying I'm very helpful and very generous with offering advice in my field. 

Am I being unreasonable to say no to a task ?
is this workplace bully?"

The second one was about my design skills. There was the interviewer and a note taker on camera.

On the second interview, the same person that interviewed me on the 1st interview told me we are going over 2 design challenges, where they would show me two pages of the company's website and I would have to say what would I improve.

They dropped the link for the first design challenge. I said what I would improve and then I got asked how would I research this page, to which I replied I would conduct usability testing where I'd see how users find info on this page and check the page's metrics to have more insight because I need more information about the problem I am solving.

Then they ended the interview after we were finished with the first challenge and I didn't get a chance to do the second one. No explanation as to why. I woke up to a generic rejection letter today.

Anyways, I hope they have fun with the free ideas they stole from me with that design challenge. Have fun profiting off my skills and stealing my livelihood."

",u/TheColaDemonCat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eg0nk8/disgusting_food_violations_at_grocery_store_where/,antiwork,"On the 28th a bad car crash happened in my town, which resulted in a major power outage for some. The power outage went from 9:30 am to 4:30/5pm, 7ish hours total. The grocery store I work for was also effected by this and they do not have any back up generators. They made us cover most things up with trash bags and put some things in the coolers/freezers. 

However, not everything was immediately placed into the freezer/coolers. A lot of the products sat out for hours before we even moved them. For example, The boar's head meat section was not placed into a cooler until 3pm when the temperatures of them started recording at 46.7 F. On top of that people kept opening the coolers/freezers at least 5 times to put stuff in, which surely made them lose a lot of cold. Given the time it would also take the coolers/freezer to reach safe temperatures after the power went back on is also questionable (and some products were immediately moved back to the shelves once the power was back on, like the olive bar). I believe if someone were to do the math, the temperatures for most of our products would be beyond legal/safe standards. 

The next day I was waiting for instructions about what i should throw out. Instructions never came. Most products in our store were never thrown out, because a corporate came to the store to ""decide"" what will/won't be thrown out. All the products I handled that needed refrigeration in my store were much too warm, but none were thrown out. 

The Walmart across from us also lost power and they did throw everything out. I personally tried to get rid of everything I deemed unsafe. Given the vast amount of raw meat (especially chicken), dairy products, etc. I find this disgusting and appalling. 

They claimed they had to report the temperatures 4 times and send them to the state (I am in TN) and that anything below 51 degrees is considered okay. I think they are lying and I am pretty sure they sent fraudulent temp numbers to cover their asses for the loss. 

What can I do, if anything, to report them for this ? Would it even do anything either ? "

For context- i have been working for this company for more than two years now, and it has gone swimmingly. I have helped my boss with things countless times, am extremely helpful to my coworkers, and have filled in whenever asked. 

This sounds normally wild- but it gets weirder. My boss is an extreme right wing republican. I am not exaggerating when i say the way she talks about Donald Trump makes her sound like she would leave her husband for him if he asked. I genuinely wouldn’t be surprised if i found out she was at the capitol on January 6th- she worships him that much. 

I recently came out to her as queer, and while she seemed to take it well, she immediately made the situation more complex and told me things like she couldn’t book me via my chosen pronouns and that she would not use them. 

She also has clearly become more deranged the past few weeks, (even more than normal,) and has been talking more and more about Trump since his attempted assassination and Kamala Harris becoming nominee. 

In the termination letter, she states that it is due to “economic circumstances” and “seniority” despite me being middle-of-the-ladder and her never having issues before. 

Honestly- this sucks and i feel terrible. I love my coworkers and i genuinely wanted to at least stay for them, despite repeated harassment from my boss for not being republican. (Yes, this has happened repeatedly.) 

Do i even have a chance to get a new job at this point? Why does the land of the free seem to care so much about people like me not being free? 

- guess i just want to vent. I really am tired of all of American politics right now, i wish i could just move somewhere where i won’t be judged for who i am. Thanks, for anyone who read this far.

TLDR: got laid off by MAGA boss after coming out as queer, wanted to vent."

I started yesterday and found out that not only is he not even my direct supervisor, my supervisor is also new and had her first day too. So far things have been really disorganized but at least it's remote. I'm really upset I wasn't at least told about this in the interview though because had I known I probably wouldn't have accepted the job as I turned down an offer before because the person I interviewed with turned out to not be my supervisor and they wouldn't let me meet with the person I'd be reporting to. Now I'm just kind of panicking because I can't leave another job and I really don't want to hate my life and be micromanaged again.

Do companies do this a lot? I really hope I don't come to regret this because I started another job that may have been better and left because I received a better offer from where I am now my second week into it."

I (27M) am an international student in Paris 3 months into a remote internship of 6 months.
The internship ends in November. 
My employer now wants me to come to the office which is 3 hours away from my place. 
For the internship which has been 100% remote up until this point, I have tried telling my employer that it's not sustainable to travel 3 hours to the office and back Totaling 6 hours for 3 days in a week. I thought that communicating this to my employer would solve the issue. But unfortunately, it seems they are very strict about this kind of policy from now on. It makes 0 sense to me since I was told in the beginning of the internship that it's OK, if the internship is remote, you do not have to come to office.
I'm also being paid only the basic salary that a student is paid in France. So safe to say that amount is not enough for me to sustain in Paris. As a result, I'm also working part-time in a fast food restaurant near me after my 9:00 to 5:00 internship to cover my expenses for the month. So my full day is packed. If I agree with this 6 hour travel time, I will have to give up the other  job. And then end up with the minimal stipend that this internship is paying me, so this is putting me at a disadvantage from every end. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to negotiate with the employer on this? Is it possible to renegotiate the salary of my internship to include the 6 hour commute time? I am aware that the most obvious suggestion in this case would be to move to a place closer to the office. But it's not possible at this point because I already have a lease in my current house up until December which I cannot break.Because I was told in the beginning of the internship that this won't be a remote internship so I would not have to move. 

I'm about to have a meeting with her tomorrow, thanks in advance for any inputs.

Basically, it seems like I, and everyone else I know, is under-employed. All fields. All education levels. 

Like, a person has a job with a solid hourly rate, but can't get enough hours. They can't get a second job either, often due to non-compete agreements or an irregular/ unpredictable schedule at their existing job.

Or, they freelance, do gigs, and it used to be ok 5 years ago, even 1 year ago, but something changed. Now, they can't get as much work on the platforms as they use to, despite still having good reviews. It seems like a person has to run paid ads on a platform like UpWork, Thumbtack or LinkedIn now, otherwise nobody sees your profile. 

Is there...research on this? What is going on? Is it just my region, or is it everywhere? Is there any data or analysis showing whether underemployment is more common, or is it just more noticable?

Just saying… don’t assume that working in the public sector will solve all of your woes. Luckily, I am moving to another public sector environment soon and hopefully it’s better because they have more funding (unlike here where it’s failing and falling apart).

In this economy?). They have open positions but are not willing to pay what’s decent for the market around us. There’s no discipline for anyone that does anything wrong, they just give continuous warnings but won’t fire anyone because they know it’s cheaper to keep them. They have created a culture that obviously works for the people that have been there for years but anyone new coming in can see the nightmare from a mile away! They don’t even have any official schedules anywhere. Everything is word of mouth. No paperwork is up to date other than what I have done… it’s literally a ticking time bomb here & I refused to be blamed for any of it. I keep a daily journal of all my tasks & have proof that my boss has even confirmed she lets other employees steal time (specifically her department heads).

I am not here to talk about any countries in particular, but rather the housing crisis, infertility crisis, unaffordability crisis that we are experiencing in the time we (especially millenials and gen-z who havent had a chance to form a family or build significant savings yet) need it the most and how it may leave us with a bitter aftertaste towards their respective countries.

A large majority of gen-Z and younger millenials, (who would be at their ideal age for enlisting) I assume, are struggling to get a home. Most are either homeless, paying for an overpriced rental (making a boomer or a corporation rich), and some less fortunate ones even homeless...

If a war were to break up in one or multiple parts of the world they would have to send robots right to fight each other right? Or have boomers figure it out how to use drones?

Who in their right mind would sacrifice their lives for a country which failed to provide them with the basic necessities (home, time outside work to raise children now that it is common for both parents to work)? Especially for very wealthy countries where this probably is has been found to be even more extreme (with a few exceptions).

In short, if a war breaks out, what will there be for the average young person to defend anyways? Since we all lie in capitalist nations, how do they expect to buy our patriotism?

What is stopping a millenial who saved up a lot to buy a house but still can't afford to buy something to just pack their things and move somewhere calmer(and more affordable) as soon as things start to turn ugly?

My manager went from a standard role to a Head of Department shortly after I joined their team. It was just us, and over time I've put in the work but felt like a puppet making my manager look amazing while I just sit in the background.


My manager would react negatively whenever I made suggestions or was asked to support on any exciting projects, to the point of sabotaging any chance of my involvement, throwing me under the bus for her mistakes, questioning my capabilites, but at other times needing my help in a panic when not capable of doing something herself. She's spoken down to me a number of times, and then apologised for being stressed. One minute she's my friend, then she's my boss. I'm constantly given extra admin tasks to do for other departments but I'm in a mid-level role! She's a bad communicator, indecisive, sh*t talks everyone, and an inexperienced manager, but gets on with the boss so untouchable 🤷🏼‍♀️ sound familiar? I'm at a point where I have little faith in my abilities and feel so trapped.

Now, they've decided to hire a new person. She told me they would be on less pay and sit below me, and that my progression can be considered so she'll speak to her manager. Then I find out they're going to have the same job title and salary as me. THEN, she calls and talks at me for 15 minutes, ""in terms of progression, we don't really work like that here... unfortunately, it's not a case of having steps to work towards and then you get promoted. It's just... keep doing what you're doing, prove yourself, and then you get promoted. Everything is fine though! So just keep doing what you're doing and see what happens..."" [another 10 minutes of negativity]. Why do we even have 1-1 performance reviews if that's the case? (She told me 7 months ago, that the managers have been told to deliberately score people lower than a rating of 5 to prevent the possibility of promotions... I wish I would have taken this further but we don't have HR)


I finally decided to move on and have applied for lots of jobs. I'm in a competitive market so it's taking a while and I'm freaking out. Currently on a 3rd stage for a managerial position, which I'm in disbelief of because deep down I want it but don't feel capable. I don't know whether it's right to stay or go, but I don't think I can take any more of this awful cliquey company's BS. It's not just her, it's the whole toxic company. They promise the world and then don't deliver... their employee turnover is insanely high. I am desperate to get out ASAP! 😩 any success stories or positive vibes would really help right now!

I'm just venting a bit, don't know where to go with this but thought about maybe seeking some advice."

I have been wanting to get a promotion to be able to afford to live, but when I read the new job postings they sound like a nightmare.  I don't even really want to leave my current position, I am just scared of rampant inflation and not being able to survive if I can't figure out how to earn more money.  I'm conflicted because I don't really want to work harder for this company, but I don't know a better way to survive.  It is a great company, and I feel proud to be there but my personal life with my family is more important to me than any corporation ever will be."

For context, I work in a nonprofit for almost year that is slowly becoming more and more toxic/hostile as the months roll by. My other colleagues are also putting in their notices not long after me but they all seem pretty calm about the whole thing.

For me, this is my first career job after college and it scares me. I tried trying to stay longer but my mental health has seriously been suffering for quite some time. I'm also putting in my notice during a pretty tight period since there's a lot of things due for this place. Any advice on how to change this thinking? It sounds stupid as I write and reread this but I really am just terrified of retaliation from upper management and them asking me questjons about why I'm leaving."

I will never live a life surrounded by how much money I can make, how much more shit I can buy, when's my next paycheck, or the stress about eviction. When people talk about investing, the stock market, internships, paychecks, interviews, a raise, I feel an immense wave of depression wash over my body.

I'm neurodivergent and typical routine work overall is much more difficult for me than it is for the average person. Aside from that, no career interests me and the concept of money overall is dystopian. Living an average life would drive me to suicide. There's no point in life if money is my reward.

Unfortunately, I cannot express this as I live in the United States and many of its citizens are simple-minded & view things as black and white. Their defense would be to call me ""Lazy"" or a ""Communist.""

Which is terrifying because they themselves often don't like their job and are struggling financially. The denial is why we are like this.

I'd LOVE to work. Work with a few animals on a no-kill farm, garden, getting my own source of electricity and water, holy shit. And teaching myself with books on how to support myself? I'd LOVE that.

I know it can be very labor intensive, but honestly I love having something to do. Especially when I set this up for myself. I know what I'm getting into.

Canning things? Eating natural food? Water without added fluoride? Practicing herbalism? Caring for animals daily? BEING IN NATURE? Just typing it out makes me wanna kick my feet in joy.

Of course, doing it alone would be excruciating. And I don't want to be isolated from humans, either. Which is why I think an intentional community aka a commune would be ideal. Or a partner / found family who resonate with my idea.

I'll have to accept the fact that I'll never escape Capitalism and it's exploitive ways. But I'm gonna get pretty damn close and set an example."

Tho today gave me more of a push to find something else. 

Boss called me into their office, I had a feeling it wasn’t gonna be good by how they looked, but I didn’t think I would get in trouble for being quiet. Here’s what I got in trouble for:

=Not asking enough questions whenever I need help with something (Except that I do. All the time to my supervisor, the person training me, before I even start on something so I don’t get anything wrong so that confused me)

=I need to ask for more work or if there’s anything to do. (Except that I have whenever I have nothing to do and still do. However, most of the time when I ask, most don’t even know what tasks to give me and give me nothing or give me tasks that could be finished in a short time) 

=I’m not doing much at work and I do too little and I just keep to myself (I’ve been doing what I’ve been tasked with that keep me busy during the day, esp dealing with customers, and ones I’m most confident in. I’m still technically in training period too so I still don’t know most of how things are done)

=I don’t answer the phone (I will admit, I’m a nervous wreck when it comes to answering the phone so I did avoid it for a short while, but I improved on it over time and I’ve been answering the phone regularly for months. But it’s weird that I’m just NOW getting that complaint than the first week when I didn’t answer it)

With those feedback, they pretty much told me that I’m too quiet and I need speak more, especially with my coworkers. This came up because of some coworkers spoke up about me and from my boss’ POV too (even tho they don’t work near me). I’ve always thought I’ve been doing what I’m supposed to and would speak when necessary or when spoken too. 

I am more introverted but I would still get my work done and talk to coworkers when I need help. I guess my quietness is more noticeable since majority of my coworkers are the chatty types and outspoken, including my boss and they all talk amongst each other.

But yea, I’m just done working at this place and currently searching for other work. The fact that some of my coworkers who complained about me seriously think I do nothing and tried to get me in trouble stresses me tf out even more sigh"

101,2024-07-30,I am going to be homeless in about 2 months. ,u/Cicatricesgrandes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ega51c/i_am_going_to_be_homeless_in_about_2_months/,antiwork,"I have been a freelance translator for 7 years (working in the clinical trials, medicine, pharma, and regulatory sectors). My work was cut in half this month. My client list was about equal - that is to say, my work was spread out equally among my clients.

I worked in a corporate translation agency (at the time, it was one of the top 3 in the world). After 10 years, no raise and no promotion, a colleague that I recommended for the manager position )after our current manager was planning to leave) turned into a tyrant. So, I quit. 

In the subsequent 7 years, things have been fine. I haven't been to a doctor or dentist or on vacation, but I am a homebody. I managed to save enough money to buy a condo (which was one of the biggest mistakes of my life). I was in the middle of a remodel so I could sell it, and the air conditioner went out; I can't find someone to replace the system from the 1970s, and I have been ghosted by the company I was working with because they ordered the wrong air conditioner. Anyway, when the work got slow, I stopped the renovation.

Anyway, I am applying for jobs, looking for more gigs, and hitting a wall. At the current rate, even with stopping the renovation, not paying taxes, and not doing anything beyond the basics (no eating out, no entertainment, no going out), I probably only have about 2 months before I run out of money.

I guess the best thing would be to pay off the car so I have a place to sleep and maybe I can get around a bit, but I don't know if going to a different city would be the right move. I don't have any family (they have all died), and most of my acquaintances are also experiencing difficult times.

I just do not know what to do. I feel like this is all my fault, like I should have handed money better, that I should have been smarter somehow. I have applied to jobs, and I am overqualified or underqualified. I don't know. I am looking for more clients, but I just do not want to be homeless again. I worked so hard to get out of the poverty I was raised in, and now, all of that work and education seems to have been for no reason.

Thanks for listening. I wish there was a safety net. I hope everyone else who is experiencing this gets something soon."

He is also frequently late with my paycheque/tips and has accused me of stealing from the till. He also frequently makes errors with the till and when I opened this morning the till was over by $100. I called him to discuss this and he claimed he forgot to do the full cash deposit when he closed. It took a lot of wheedling, but I eventually got him to put it in writing. 

He hosted an event tonight and did a few things that set off my radar, and made me feel a bit suspicious. 

He sent me on pointed errands downstairs a few times.

And most suspiciously, when he handed me my cash tips, he tried to make me process a cash transaction at the till while I still had my tips in hand. I refused to do it and had him place my tips in a paper envelope and had him label it, seal it, and sign it himself. 

He bought me a cannabis drink during the event (I work at a dispensary) and I only consumed it AFTER I closed my till and clocked out. 

Tonight, near close, he calls me and accuses me of stealing an envelope full of cash. First, he said it was on the table when he was giving me my tips and I pointed out that the envelope of my tip money was sealed and signed by him. He accused me of bringing my purse behind the cash and I pointed out that when I brought my purse up from downstairs, I never brought my purse behind the cash, I put it in front of the till where he could see it. He pointedly mentioned that I went downstairs a few times during the event (because he sent me downstairs). He finally dropped the matter when I told him I saw him walking around with an envelope, and that my purse was accounted for the entire time, and the style of dress I was wearing made it impossible to conceal money on my person. 

I want to quit immediately before he tries this again, but what’s the best way to protect myself and prove that he has been trying to frame me? "

I was fairly vocal about disagreeing with policy changes over the last year that made no sense and also pushed back (although not intensely, I followed along but made sure it was clear I disagreed) on new responsibilities that were added to my job description without any increase in pay or incentives for us. I told only a few people I trusted I was looking and interviewing but out of the blue I was pulled aside and fired without any prior warnings a few weeks ago. I can't prove it but I think someone told them I was on my way out and they decided to cut their losses and let me go instead of letting me take any company leads or info with me while I was looking.

Slaved for 60 hours a week for years for people who didn't ever appreciate it beyond the monetary value and this proves they never gave a fuck about how I felt, easier to cut the cord and pay me severance than to try to make any changes to retain me or even have a conversation about why I even wanted to leave in the first place.

- managers don't have time for training, so there wasn't any. I've all just been given a desk and logins and then expected to suddenly pick up tasks with no lead in.

- everyone works free overtime, every day. When I arrive, there are people already there, & when I leave none of them move.  That's on top of already longer than normal contractual hours.

- members of the team talk about being overwhelmed, stressed and having too much on all the time. 
In response, we had a meeting from management about looking at ""how we can be more efficient and get more done with our time"".

- all my tasks are underestimated in scope, and all my weeks are constantly overbooked. By their own estimates, this week I'm doing 9 days worth of work, somehow. 
There's no sign of that ever letting up. There are no quiet periods, because all the requests are internal, so we're doing it to ourselves.

I don't think I've ever felt so burnt out by a job, so quickly. Genuinely tempted to quit before my probation is up and find something else because even being unemployed and searching was better than this. "

[https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1egbsje/marvel\_employee\_reveals\_his\_salary/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1egbsje/marvel_employee_reveals_his_salary/?sort=new)

You can look back through history and see super stars of yesterday used to become uber wealthy.  If you look back in time even further, they became wealthy, but perhaps not uber wealthy.  Look even further back, and meh.

You can also look through history and see that the first versions of whatever popular games from decades ago made the creators, the developers very, very wealthy.  

Nowadays, Netflix and similar have strived hard to commoditize the people that create the value, that create the wealth.  They even do it to the actors.  It's a business strategy.  

Anyhow, RDJ is from the era of superstars who built some clout.  It's no doubt that in some way he got his start because of being connected to wealth, but he is also of that era before the commoditization of actors.  So he can continue to bankroll on that, because the truly wealthy have ascertained with careful calculations, that adding him to a film will yield the highest return for them.

And that is where this is going.  Across all industries, in every aspect of our lives now, there are well-connected, well-guarded groups of people and families who have established themselves as the gatekeepers, the middlemen, the rent-seekers.  While it may be surprising to learn that RDJ made $80,000,000 for a single movie, he doesn't hold a candle to how much the uber wealthy who control the media we get to see made.  The same is true for athletes.  The same is now true for your game developers.  It takes a lot of funneling, a lot of overhead, a lot of people now, to support the top, the uber wealthy pulling all the strings.

And this is where it should be very concerning, just like they pull the strings on the media we consume, the entertainment, the games and sports.  The news we read.  They have now commandeered our government, our so-called representatives of the people.  The very same groups, the very same names, the very same families wield their level of wealth to influence and control it all.  They are the middlemen, the rent-seekers, the scalpers of democracy now.

So while they have you distracted by red team rah rah rah and blue team go go go, and every other superficial silly matter, meant to divide us, they are conquering us.  

Anyhow, I think it is silly to complain about making $12 an hour while comparing to RDJ or similar who are making $80,000,000 a movie.  You're concerned about the wealth disparities at the wrong level, with the wrong people.  You need to think bigger, and about the things that keep you oppressed, keep you struggling, kept your parents struggling, and will continue to do so for generation after generation.  Get united again.  There are way more of us than them.  We may not have the power of ephemeral dollars, but we have the power of numbers and will."

I'm so fed up with the mess left by the previous employee, the lack of any training, and these fucking absurd demands. I came here to work as an IT specialist, and I end up doing a job that has nothing to do with IT. Who the fuck came up with this?

Every day, I wake up thinking I have to deal with something I was completely unprepared for. I thought I'd be fixing systems, programming, doing something that makes sense and gives me satisfaction. But no, instead, I have to mess around with steel constructions like some fucking blacksmith. This is a fucking joke, not a job.

It's not about the previous employee being an idiot, although the mess he left suggests otherwise. This is all the fault of those assholes upstairs who have no idea how to run a company. No training, no support, and expectations as if I've been working in this industry forever. Who the fuck runs a company like that?

Every day, it feels like someone is screwing with me, throwing me in the deep end without a single fucking lifeline. I have to listen to the bullshit from the management, who have no clue what's happening on the ground. It feels like they treat me as a cog in the machine that's supposed to just work without complaining.

This drives me insane. Instead of doing what I love and what I'm good at, I'm wasting time on some fucking tasks that I couldn't care less about. Every day at this shitty job is a battle against windmills. I feel like I'm wasting my time, health, and energy on something that makes no sense.

In moments like this, the only thing that comes to mind is to quit this shit. I'm tired of being a pushover in a company that can't take care of its employees. It's time to finally say enough, throw those fucking papers, and find something that really makes sense. Something where I can do what I love and where people will respect me. Because I'm definitely not going to keep wasting my life in this fucking shithole."

Need to justify paying an employee less / a very low wage? Degrade their job by adding the word 'assistant' to the job title. You are just a mere assistant, therefore we will pay you very little

Want to retain staff in underpaid, 'unskilled' roles by beefing the role up? Subway 'sandwich artist's, Bin / Trash men 'Refuse Recycling Expert', Insurance call centre with ""Personal Injury Claims Technician"" etc. Usually the hardest, most stressful and yet lowest paid jobs. 

Want to give somebody a great sense of importance and ego boost to retain? Or maybe pay somebody the same for taking on more responsibilities? Give them a long ass job title with bold 'important' words ""Lead Technical Product Overseer Of Customer Relations Expert""

If you are ever applying for jobs in future, pick whatever title you like for any previously worked roles making it sound fancy. It's just a title with no reflection on how challenging your role is, yet it seems to have a lot of weighting in this world."

4,2024-07-31,Disability & Discrimination ,u/rescuemeowwooffamily,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1egkjus/disability_discrimination/,antiwork,"I’m on disability for breast cancer and I get $1107 a month for SSDI. I was just recently approved. 
My private disability insurance through work at Di$ney is “Fartford”.
Fartford requires people to apply for social security.

I paid for this Fartford long term disability insurance at Di$ney for 9 years & they are cutting me off. That would have been $800 more. But they’ve tried to cut me off many times. They supposedly pay 60% of my last wage ( $18/hour)so it’s $12/hour x 40 for up to 10 years. But they hound you every month for proof from your doctors that your chronic disability didn’t suddenly go away & this costs lots of money in copayments & money to doctors to fill out these required reports. Then the next month Fartford asks for the same information. They even canceled me for noncompliance because they didn’t get reports from doctors I didn’t have. I have had to fight Fartford for disability since the beginning. They send reams of doctors’ documentation requests by fax, often the same requests, on monthly basis. That means you have to spend every cent you don’t have on medical visits to prove your chronic diagnosis didn’t suddenly magically disappear. Some doctors require payments for these documents. You have to have really good health insurance! And pay all those copayments & the doctors fees for documents!

Di$ney, my former employer, officially transferred me to a desk job when I was bald from chemotherapy. I was diagnosed at the same time. But I had been doing the job with a “pay-up” for about a year without the official job status. I told management but all of management knew I had breast cancer. A manager also told me “we don’t do accommodations” but if you want to wear a hat you’ll need an accommodation.” So I sent in the forms with doctor signature saying I needed a hat because my immune system is compromised & the building is cold in some areas in the warehouse especially offices. So I walked around bald until it was approved. This was an area “off stage” where we did not wear company uniforms “costumes”. The company approved only a “black knit hat”.
(I didn’t have the $200 for the copay on a wig. I guess I could have found an itchy donation.)

Then not even a year out of cancer treatment, disney managers brought me into a room & told me “we don’t do accommodations” for work —warehouse work — that was not officially on my job description . It included hours of heavy lifting of 50 to 100 pound rolls of fabric & boxes & using heavy warehouse machinery. I asked if workers’ comp was covered for these job requirements not listed on the job description. The Attorney in Employee Relations at Di$ney verbally told me she would get me the official job description & proof of insurance coverage for the role. She  never did. 

Workers get screwed if they work outside the official job description if they get injured. 

A year later Di$ney changed the official job description & official job name because they had to get approval from the union. But Di$ney had already gotten rid of me. And others too disabled, too old, too brown, too accented in English speaking…

Companies like Di$ney get away with this routinely. After a year being in Medical Leave of Absence Limbo leave of absence (after one year of leave of absence Di$ney will terminate the employee) 
Di$ney finally gave me an “accommodation” a week before termination, as “Park Greeter” at magic kingdom that gets up to 50,000 guests a day). The job actually was rather more physical than an indoor desk job & required standing in extreme heat & having thousands of unmasked people stand within less than 12 inches from you. Some touching you. 

This is where Di$ney put me & where they put most disabled people— PTSD, autism & people in wheelchairs & rollator walkers… All sorts of disabilities crammed into this job together. 

I use a rollator walker now sometimes because cancer treatments wrecked my sense of balance. Disabled people get shoved into just a few roles at Di$ney. And this role is absolutely dangerous to disabled people. Have you ever seen the skin of someone who is in a wheelchair who sits in the heat & sun (up to 90F to 110F)? The skin mascerates & begins to loose blood flow. Skin ulcers can begin easily, just from the fold of fabric—Stiff unbreathing polyester fabric for Magic Kingdom Park Greeter Costumes 

I have seen Skin ulcers to the bone on a homeless person in a wheelchair— a veteran.
But Di$ney thinks this is an accommodation for mobility disabled people, including veterans.

After one week of being a Park Greeter, I ended up in the hospital with Covid (3rd time—2nd from work). (Big pay cut). I was still in training.
I went back to work three weeks later & ended up in the hospital again with heat exposure & my kidneys shutting down. Lots of fun hospital bills I’m responsible for because Covid is not included in workers comp & extreme heat is still being studied on at the federal level. 
Of course, Di$ney did not tell OSHA I was hospitalized a year ago. They were supposed to but somehow forgot. I wonder how many other workers they forgot to notify OSHA about heat related hospitalizations? Or Covid deaths? How many people/workers at Disney have died from Covid? I personally knew 2. I know more people who were in hospital on ventilators.

I haven’t worked since & that was a year ago. 

This country wouldn’t need so many people on disability if we were not discriminated against. And private disability does everything to kick you off especially now since so many people became disabled from Covid. 

Rick Scott got rich from Medicare fraud now wants to get rid of social security & Medicare/medicaid. It’s basically genocide by omission. Trump & Vance & Scott & more politicians want to promote eugenics policies to get rid of what they consider the undeserving & undesirable

If the Orange Coprolite gets in, say goodbye to even more civil rights & workers rights. Say goodbye to overtime pay. Say goodbye to OSHA. 
DeSantis just signed a law allowing Florida companies get off from killing their workers by heat exposure & dehydration, including children now working dangerous physical labor outside in the heat. But that was always there with migrant children as farm laborers. Now it applies to the rest of us. 

Oh yes, I have a charge with EEOC but it’s still under investigation even after the hundreds of pages of documents I provided as proof. I’m just over 2 years in. I completely understand the EEOC is playing catchup on their organization being turned into an international bottleneck. Trump decimated the EEOC so it’s still recovering. And if he gets in he plans to do worse than before. Remember Clarence Thomas, original bottleneck promoter) was chairman of EEOC under president Regan. If you were around, you might remember Anita Hill , a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, accused him of sexual harassment. Believe her now?
Somehow, I doubt the Right Wing Supremes will allow the EEOC to survive. So I realize the Di$ney’s  “leave of absence limbo “ technique is  just waiting for the EEOC to go away. 

So protect yourself! 
Vote & keep the Orange Turd from returning to the Presidency!"

I used to never call out of work and generally took pride in my work. About two years ago I had to take a step back from the field I enjoyed because the pay wasn’t realistic anymore even though 4 years ago I was living pretty comfortably. My spouse wanted to go to nursing school which I figured in the long run would be a great idea to increase our household income so I decided to bite the bullet and leave my job that I loved so that I could go work in car sales and support us while she’s in school. Well, fast forward a couple of years and I’m making the most money I’ve ever made in my life and I’m somehow the brokest I’ve ever been in my life. We live below our means, we live in a single wide trailer and I drive a piece of crap truck. I make enough money to pay the bills but not enough to save for any kind of future. I feel like the more I make, the more money the government takes from me. I’m sick of waking up every day and going to my job that I hate just so I can make money to afford to go back to work. I’m sick of working til my brain is numb just for two measly days off (which aren’t even consecutive) then rinsing and repeating. I can’t even enjoy my days off anymore because it’s not enough time to do anything I want to do and it’s just overshadowed by the fact that I have to go back to my desk in the morning. By the time I’m out of work I get like 4 hours of free time which is usually eaten up by household chores, errands, and maybe an hour of actually doing something I want to do. I literally had a mental breakdown this morning and called out of work because I can’t do it anymore. Not to mention I get absolutely r$&ped on rent for a place that I never even get to spend time at. I’ve been trying to by a house for two years with my VA home loan but every time I try I get outbid by some wall street asshole who’s going to probably charge 3k a month for rent because the housing market where I live is absolutely shot, trailers are selling for 250k+. I’m also sick of paying into social security which I’ll likely never get to use. I’m sick of my boomer co workers looking at me sideways when I say I want more out of life then just coming to a job I hate every day. I’m sick of having no time to do anything I want. I’m to the point where I’m considering going back into the military because I don’t remember ever being this mentally miserable. Yeah that’s right, my work life balance was somehow better as an infantryman in the army. Make that make sense. I’d rather spend another year in the desert then spend another day in the American work force. It all feels like a scam. I’ve followed all the steps I’m supposed to and it’s not enough. There has to be more to life than just working so someone else can afford their 5th sports car or in ground pool. I’m tired man. I’m trying to stay strong for my spouse but I can’t do it anymore. I feel like I’m wasting all of my potential just so I can afford to live. My spark is completely gone. Thanks for listening to my probably incoherent vent, I just needed to get this off my chest. "

  Umbrella never actually raised my pay for the position or updated my title, but I have been performing those responsibilities and maintaining my training for ten years.

I quit mine to start a small handyman business and absolutely blindsided my manager by quitting on a Friday with no notice after 7.5 years with the company. 

They feel like they owe you nothing. They will not mourn the loss of you -- only you believe they will. 

Plan your escape and when you're ready? ....leave. 

We've lived, for a very long time, under this weird paradigm where we are supposed to be thankful and have all sorts of considerations for our jobs when they've given us zero. Literally the bare minimum. 

Minimum health insurance, minimum wage, minimum effort on the part of management, just minimum everything. 

And you are expected to be ""maximum"" all day every day. How's that work exactly? How is this an even trade? 

It's not. It's the result of a largely fascist country that has made us believe we're lucky to be employed. 

No, you're lucky to have us because if you didn't, the person who *started that company* would still be pushing a broom across the floor at the end of the night. May their high towers crumble, may their fields burn and the ground be salted beneath their feet.

I’ve been doing this shit for 5 years now and I’m beyond sick of it. I’m not depressed, but I’m definitely angrier than I’ve ever been in my life all because of work. Little things trigger it. Like today I was told I have to stop coming in early/leaving early (I do this to avoid traffic) and it set me off. I’ve just been sitting at my desk pissed off getting angry that this is my life for the next 3+ decades. 

I know many 20 somethings that feel very similar. In fact, I do not know anyone in their 20s that thinks 5 days/minimum 40 hours is sustainable or okay. 

I work with mostly older people who voluntarily work 60-70 hour weeks, unlike me who slams their laptop closed at 3:53 everyday (thank you time clock rounding). Do they not have hobbies? Being gone 10 hours a day infuriates me and I can’t mentally do a second more. 

The best times of my life have been when I have had time off work. For example, I quit my job in April and took 3 weeks off before my new one and then negotiated a “pre-planned” vacation and had another 2 weeks off last month. This has been the best summer of my adult working life (aka since college). It is incredibly frustrating that if I want that much time off again, I’ll need to quit my job. 

So my question is really for people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s…does this get better and more tolerable?"

I am a uni student who does part time work mostly in bars/pubs. I recently left a place where the landlord of the pub was toxic, constantly taking out his foul mood on employees and clearly discriminating against one of my female co-workers (whom he fired 5 minutes into her shift on the weekend) 

I managed to quit that job a few weeks ago and came across an old co-worker who had quit about a month before me the other night. We spent a while talking about our experiences and basically saying how shit the job was. Someone clearly overheard our conversation and went and told him that people were slagging him off publicly and he either called everyone who quit in the last 3 months or what we spoke about made it obvious and he called me this morning asking if I had been saying anything. I denied this because if he’s willing to call me 3 weeks after I quit over someone complaining about him what else would he do? He even made a passing comment that sounded like a threat before he ended the call, something along the lines of “don’t speak about it again or next time I’ll personally come down there (the pub we were drinking in at the time) myself”

I know I’m partially at fault for slagging him and his business off so publicly but I feel like calling to basically harass me about it is out of line.

TL;DR quit my job, started slagging off the place I quit when I met with an old coworker, old boss found out and basically called to threaten me over it. 

Just wanted other peoples thoughts on the situation as I’m likely not going to get paid for the month I did before I left

I currently work as an in an administrative job, it's honestly the worst job I've ever had.

The work itself, although allying, is not the problem, the problem is that in this area, each micro task is controlled by my boss and subject to daily quotas.

I can't stand this anymore.

If it was just a company with similar conditions I would say no problem, just change, but it's my 7th employer and it's generally still the same and I end up leaving or getting fired.



I come to the conclusion that I need to find a job where I can accomplish my tasks in a few hours.  
  
Or that the tasks are not verifiable so that it is not possible to say whether I work a lot or not.



**So for people who can work a few hours a day without this being a problem.**

Again, no worried because I have a job and I know this is a red flag. Then they ask me to do a background and drug screen, very a-typical at this stage in my experience, but again, no worries, I'm already employed so if this doesn't work out, I at least can post the salary places to help others applying to the same roles. Complete both the drug and background and just got the offer... $15 an hour.

I love the job, absolutely love it. I'm fortunate in that it doesn't feel like work to me and I genuinely enjoy it, but recently I've been called out on my ""tardiness"". 

So I usually show up like 3 minutes before shift start so that I can dump all my stuff in the lockers before actually starting handover. Today my unit nurse manager called me aside to tell me that I need to get there 15-20min early so that I can start getting handover if there was a lot to cover from the last shift (I should note that there is double staffing during shift changes, so the last shift will be there for an overlap of about 2 hours). I'm good at my job because I enjoy it, and even my manager told me that I'm ""absolutely fantastic in all other aspects"". 

I don't mind if I got paid for it, but we don't go with a clock in/out system, so you just get paid for your rostered hours (this also includes if you need to stay late 30mins to finish up some things or help out the oncoming staff). 

I have always hated people telling me that I NEED to be somewhere earlier than my start time, this even goes for interviews or meetings. If you want me there earlier, PAY ME for that time, otherwise it just feels like you're taking advantage of the relationship. 

This happened while I was a student nurse and on placement (unpaid clinical rotations) that was legit 40 hours a week for 3-6 weeks. I just ignored them and kept showing up when I was meant to start because I'm not even getting paid to be there, why would I use more time to work more?

Our complex used to have 8 working washing machines, and we are now down to a single working machine (we've been begging them to fix this for 24 months at least.) There are no firewalls between units and the electric is not up to code. (I have to unplug my fridge while I cook, cause it it kicks on while I run my microwave while cooking on the electric range, it blows a fuse.) The bathrooms aren't properly ventilated. I keep the bathroom window (in the shower) open year round, and I have to spray bleach on my fucking walls to prevent the mold from taking over. I've vocally complained to my landlord, and in a fit of desperation called code enforcement. Code enforcement notified my landlord, never came out to look at the issues, and a week later I got a notice I was not being renewed and would be evicted if I am still there after 60 days after the lease ends. I'm being revenge evicted, which I know is illegal, but even if I go to court, it would buy me a year of staying in my current shit hole. I have a lawyer on it, but the wheels of justice move slowly. I've been looking at new places for the past 6 months to get an idea of what the cost was going to be to move. I will have to pay 47% of my income to rent a place that's physically safe. Keeping the cost constrained to 30% of my income just gets me an even smaller shit hole that is just as unsafe. Jesus Christ this shit is out of control.

If youre saying no experince required or paid training what more do i need to do to be ""in line""? 

Everyone says no one wants to work anymore but yet theyll turn people away due to lack of experience, which id understand if i was applying to be an engineer or some shit but you literally said no experience required.

Is it irrational for me to have left work early when I found out my boss has 1. Gone to the hospital 2 days prior and 2. Has a 104 degree fever?

Recently I gave my month’s notice (required by law, as I’m in Europe) due to burnout caused by all the crap caused by my boss, who also co-owns the company. 

When I gave the notice, pretty much the only thing the boss asked me to do was to prepare a list of people who underperform so that they can be let go at the same time I’ll be leaving the company. 
I didn’t prepare such list because of two reasons. Firstly, why would I want to throw anyone under the bus. Secondly, I believe that currently there are no underperforming people, so there’s no need to let anyone go. 
I always thought of my boss as lacking leadership skills and empathy, but the answer I got regarding the empty list of people to fire left me baffled. I got a message that I have to fire a specific person because the boss “doesn’t want to work with that person”. Of course there was no room for arguing and even the HR department was not able to say a word. Ultimately I participated in the meeting to soften the blow of serving the papers to the person, as it would happen with or without me. I try to understand the reasoning behind this, but nonetheless, this was one of the most absurd things I had to take part in during my career as a lead.

Holy crap, am I happy to jump this ship. Even though I don’t have anything new aligned, the uncertainty of the job market beats the stomach-turning stress induced by this hellhole."

Last week was my first day at this spa, everything went really well, I got along with the clients and my other coworkers, I even made my schedule for the next week right before I left.

I am personable, hard working, time efficient, and reliable, so based on what they had told me she was looking for, I thought I would be a  perfect fit, and so did the general manager who hired me , until the next morning. When I came in for my shift that day, she fired me in front of another employee without the decency to take me in the back. The reason she gave was that ""I was too big"" for that particular spa, alluding to the fact that I was very well experienced and had big dreams for my future in the esthetic industry. In her words, she said I wouldn't be a good fit without further elaboration despite my asking. Regardless of my future goals for myself I really wanted to get my foot in the door and learn everything there was to know about the spa industry. 

Now, being fired from a job is not the end of the world but the way she handled the situation was extraordinarily unprofessional and inconsiderate. Not believing that I was a good fit because I'm overqualified is fine, but that is something I believe you should decide BEFORE you hire someone, not on their second day. She could have sent me a text last night, but instead she waited until 8 in the morning on my second day, and after I had already quit my other job for this one, to fire me and in front of another employee no less. 

I really wanted to sue but the state I’m in is an “At will” state and can terminate you for any reason at any time. I was furious and called her out right then and there, I was so excited to get a job in my industry despite it being a lower pay then what I would have liked it would be my first job in the esthetic industry and important step/foot in the door to help me find something better later down the road. 

So now I’m back to the hellish landscape that is job hunting. I wish employers would stop playing with us like this and wasting our time 😭😭😭😭😭"

I’ve been working at my current position for a few years now and when I first started I loved it. I was appreciated and rewarded for my hard work. I overhauled pretty much everything I could to bring this company into the modern era. 

I’ve been having health issues which require me to work from home a couple days a week. At first they were understandable, but now that these health issues are still ongoing I’m getting “called out” by the hire ups saying that I “really need to be in office.” I really don’t. I can do almost everything from home, going in even 3 times a week would be overkill as when I do, I usually end up doom scrolling for the entire day as there’s not even a single email for me to reply to. I’ve done my job so well that everything is either damn close to automated or only takes me a few minutes to actually put together (minus big projects but those are far and few between in the slow months). 

I have never missed a meeting, frequently travel for meetings (even ones I don’t necessarily need to be at), and work off the clock for emergencies very frequently. Even have my Apple Watch notify me of any emails whenever and wherever I am so I can always reply as quickly as possible. It’s not like I just don’t do anything ever. I just work quickly and don’t let things pile up so I only really do actual work about an hour a day at this point. 

I’m bored, and after a comment from my boss asking if I’m really dedicated to the team is making me question if I’ve outgrown this job. I’m not learning anything new, I’m almost too experienced at this point for this particular job, and all of my friends have moved on. I don’t even get paid anywhere near what I should be for my position title. 

I’ve been rage applying to jobs and I’m tempted to get an offer from somewhere else and just email a resignation letter and leave without notice. I’m the only one trained to do my job and it took them over 3 rounds of interviews just to find me, I doubt they’d be able to find anyone else; so if I take this route I’d be screwing them over massively and potentially cost them lots of time and money. I’m also tempted to leverage another offer (if I get one) to get a raise and work from home. I do still love what I do and the industry I’m currently in, though I’m a bit scared they’ll say yes to my demands but only until they find someone to replace me, but I highly doubt this as the bosses only actually work about 1 day a week and didn’t even want anything to do with the hiring process during my interview period. But I’m not sure what the best option for me is. 

Thoughts? Anyone else been in a similar situation?

I can’t transfer because no other existing locations in the region. “Impending doom” wasn’t disclosed to me before being hired. 

They gave us a month notice so I have time to find another job and I should be fine but it’s just ridiculous I’d get hired just to be fired. "

It was recommended to me by a family member, so I spend 3+ hours(i'm slow) carefully filling out my information.  Then I get to searching for the positions on thr site.

Every.  Single.  Listing.  Every single listing redirected me to a new employment site for me to sign up and re-enter my information.  

I give up.  I'll live in a cardboard box."

But sometimes employers are super anal and if you don't have that specific experience core to that job, you won't get calls back.

Any advice or tips on how to increase call backs from jobs.

It's just annoying to apply over and over and not get calls back. 

Yeah , it was fine doing that when being a new graduate but now it's just annoying. "
1019,2024-07-31,Today was my last day.,u/TestPatienceTest,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eh1aan/today_was_my_last_day/,antiwork,"I did it. I quit my career. 

I’ve been software developer working for huge corporations for the last 16 years. I’ve worked many systems and met many nice people.

However I couldn’t take it anymore. Getting paid the bare amount while the company collects millions and millions a day. Watching upper management as they patted themselves on the back and gave themself raises. I was never able to shake the feeling that I was disposable. For the longest time I couldn’t break away from their incentives. I didn’t understand that there were other ways for people to live.

But it’s finally quiet now.

No more systems, no more bugs, no more legacy code. No more  security vulnerabilities, migrations, repositories, branches, breaches, logs, traces, optimizations, outages or performance reviews.

I’ve worked in this career through multiple natural disasters. Faking smiles in meetings while pretending that there weren’t helicopters overhead, wildfires fires in the area, pandemics and an attempted insurrections. I had to pretend they didn’t exist. Had to keep the systems up and the bosses fed.

But no more.

I’ll still work, but for me instead. 
 I don’t think I can live without being productive. I’ve developed a plan to make money, just enough to get by at first. It won’t be as comfortable as before, but at-least it will be on my terms. 

I can take my time back. I’ll finally have time. Time to hike, fish, build/create and play. Most importantly, I’ll have more time with my family. I am the luckiest person alive right now.

I wanted to share this here. I don’t know who else to tell. I don’t mean to come off as pretentious, I’m just so sick of work.

All there is to do right now is rest. I am so tired. 

Fuck work. Fuck corporations.

I am going to bed."

I posted a while back about this situation. See my post history for reference.

I finally heard back from OCR regarding the report I filed against my supervisor. They sent me a rather lengthy letter, which cited laws and explanations as to how my complaint was valid and rightfully reported. They are going to conduct an informal investivation into the matter ala a company-wide audit.

Turns out they are being truthful about this. We had a mandatory work meeting over Teams this afternoon, and my boss mentioned that auditors are coming to visit us in August. So hopefully this is a victory?

Once again, thank you guys so very much for your advice. I really do appreciate you all. ❤️"

It was denied. I can’t believe they would find it easier for me to quit my position of two years and to hire a new person instead of just letting me work one less day a week. I ignorantly thought there was a higher chance of my request being approved. I’m so disappointed. I really love my coworkers and have great benefits, and I have worked so hard to get to where I am confident in my role. 
The person I submitted the letter to has not made ANY effort to reach out to me to ask why I’m even making this request. They also did not tell me directly about the denial and had my manager tell me instead. 
I feel so defeated. "

They call themselves leaders but they can't even manage the team. Nene did anything but have some other worthless job such as a project manager. 

Everything they do is  for their  own gain and they are involved  in things outside the team.  Things that take priority over the team to that end. 

Disconnected from the team and judge you based on superficial observations in the 1 meeting they are in. 

I spent my life humming my skills to produce for the closing
Company. And yet I am less value??
